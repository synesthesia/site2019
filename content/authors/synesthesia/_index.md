I take a proactive and commercially astute approach to applying innovative technology to business problems. I'm experienced in working at senior management and board level to inform the strategic process, and just as comfortable working hands-on with marketing specialists, designers and developers in a CTO role.

During my career I have developed substantial technology management experience with both direct and outsourced teams, in complex commercial and not-for-profit businesses.

I also have experience of board-level engagement with a social enterprise delivering housing to persons in need.
