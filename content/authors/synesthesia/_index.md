I started my professional life as a technologist when TV screens (and the cameras that fed them pictures) still had vacuum tubes in them, and thatâ€™s where I started, learning the nuts and bolts of keeping a small TV station on the air. And now I will just as happily work with multi-skilled teams to devise modern applications to help your business.

The linking thread is a lifelong curiosity about how things work, and how people use technology to get "the job" done.

Along the way I've developed a fascination about how we develop and share knowledge, either as individuals or collectively.

I like to think I am both proactive and pragmatic in applying innovative technology to business problems. I'm experienced in working at senior management and board level to inform and co-create strategy, and just as comfortable working hands-on with marketing specialists, designers and developers in a CTO role.

During my career I have developed substantial technology management experience with both direct and outsourced teams, in complex commercial and not-for-profit businesses.

I also have experience of board-level engagement with a social enterprise delivering housing to persons in need.

As far as I'm concerned, this blogging thing is entirely [Euan Semple's](http://euansemple.blog/) fault for introducing me to it back in 2001. As you can see from this site it has been an on-off-on-off-on sort of thing since then. 

This blog is likely to meander and stutter, there's 19 years of history right here to prove that, but it's "not dead yet"...

It shouldn't need saying but my opinions represent only me, and are not in any way endorsed by or associated with any organisation I work with.

Feel free to comment, but I reserve the right to delete anything that is offensive, off track or spam.
