Some useful notes and links [here][1]  from [Steve Mordue][2] , CEO of ForceWorks on [Account-Based Marketing][3], and ways to adapt the native behaviour of Dynamics 365 to support it.

Beyond his suggestions I think the following are key in terms of building and information base about your target accounts:

  * acquire as much contextual information about accounts as possible, via both automated and human sources
  * whilst acquiring as much data as possible about individual customer interactions on touchpoints, put significant effort into linking those individuals to an account
  * when customising the touchpoint experiecne for an individual, take into consideration their account context, including other recognised individuals
