In order to structure a broad overview of e-learning tools for colleagues I set out a simple two-dimensional grid of cardinality against time:

* cardinality - how many learners are working together, simplified to 1 v many
* time - synchronous learning (in real time) v asynchronous learning (each learner chooses when to undertake an activity)
