A group of Southern Hemisphere Microsoft experts are running a month of live broadcasts under the hashtag [M365May](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/M365May), [more info](https://regarding365.com/microsoft-365-may-weeks-1-and-2-m365may-3f4b173267b4)

[Helen Blunden](https://mobile.twitter.com/ActivateLearn) ran a session on [How to Build Your Personal Learning Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA0vKYhGQmg)

## Notes

Here are my rough notes and links to resources that Helen mentions:

* modelling based on most interesting project you have learned from - apply those ways of learning to your work
* think about filtering content you find using hashtags - in other words the early beginnings of establishing your own trusted sources
* the things we learned at school and university are often not used at all, and when they are the knowledge becomes obsolete more and more quickly - see Buckminster Fuller Knowledge Doubling (as augmented by IBM), see Half Life of Facts
* learning through connections and networks - see Microsoft "Where Work Gets Done), see Harold Jarche PKM
* Create personal learning plan (Helen's approach, this bit mostly in her words)
  * what's the problem
  * what do you need to achieve? (visualise this - make a rich picture)
  * who can help? build a personal learning network, identify trusted sources (cf Jarche **seek**-sense-share), use tools to help, online communities, twitter lists, look at who in your workplace
  * what tools and resources do you have access to?
    * online courses and sources
    * curation tools
  * is it safe to learn? (at work) - culture, support, how can you incorporate your learning into a work project?
  * what can I test on?
  * how do you know you are on track? (feedback)
  * how do  I create meaning and relevancy? ([Sensemaking](https://pkm.wiki.synesthesia.co.uk/view/welcome-visitors/view/sense), reflection, examples of vlogging, blogging, wakelet)
  * where can I apply the learning?
  * who else needs to know? / how can I help others?  (**Share**)
  * how do I record what I learned? (build a portfolio - and make this independent of your employer)
* make a plan - use template?
