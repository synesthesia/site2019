## Kaizen

Interesting data this week - although I logged fewer "at work" hours, the focus hours and focus percentage both increased.

{{< figure src="pomo-2020-W06.jpg" title="PomoDoneAnalysis week 2020-W06" lightbox="true" >}}

Looking at the year to date the increase in focus percentage is striking.

{{< figure src="hours-2020-01-to-06.jpg" title="Ratio of focus time to working time, 2020 weeks 1-6" lightbox="true" >}}

Its tempting to speculate what may have led to this - I suspect it may because I knew at the start of the week that I might have less time available (due to an open-ended family commitment) and so perhaps that drove more focus in the time I *was* available. Doug Belshaw has [expressed something similar](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2020/02/08/weeknote-06-2020/):
>There’s less slack time, which is a good thing as it means you’re laser-focused on what needs to be done, and intolerant of distraction.

It will be interesting to see what week 7 brings because I already know much of one day is taken up with an all-hands meeting.
