A short week - in fact just one working day.

I've decided to get a little bit analytic about where I spend my time and focus at work, to see if I can glean any actionable knowledge about my own habits. I've decided to experiment with [PomoDoneApp](https://pomodoneapp.com/)

* it is built around the Pomodoro technique, [which I have previously found useful](/2010/12/18/blending-pomodoro-and-gtd/)
* it has multiple platform offerings
* it fits with the key task / issue tools I use
