>This session is to give an overview of powerapps-specflow-bindings, an open-source automated UI testing framework for Power Apps. This framework is being used and maintained by Capgemini and is built on top of the popular open-source EasyRepro library from Microsoft.

>This framework drastically reduces the effort required to create automated UI tests that follow best practices. In addition, it handles many common problems, such as: test parallelisation, data setup and clean-up, and user identities.

>The repository can be found at https://github.com/Capgemini/powerapps-specflow-bindings
