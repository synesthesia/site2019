## Kaizen

A huge drop in tracked focused work to compared to the previous work, in the context of fewer hours "at the coalface" - "only" 45 this week. Focus to non-focus ratio of 67% which is also a drop.

{{< figure src="pomo-2020-W04.jpg" title="PomoDoneAnalysis week 2020-W04" lightbox="true" >}}

Main causes:
* a lot of meetings related to co-ordination (as opposed to decision-making or co-construction)
* time spent generating co-ordination material for those meetings
* lower energy levels due to a niggling health issue

Possible improvement ideas:

* push more co-ordination meetings to async formats
* keep a better log of "working time" in order to track changes in the focus/non-focus ratio
* keep a log of factors relating to energy level, ability to concentrate etc

Another thought is around classification of time - conversations which are about building and sustaining professional relationships should probably be classified as focused work. But  don't want to get into circular argument about "what is waste".

## Other highlights

* delivered proof of concept of our "delayed response" architecture - next steps are to work with sales and marketing colleagues to pin down where we want to first put into use
