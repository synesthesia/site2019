## Things I learned

- Some of the possibilities from adding [Durable Entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities?tabs=csharp) to function apps. Looking at persisting current state of multiple distributed transactions from an integration to feed a dashboard

- Finally got my hands on a version of Windows10 that would support [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions#whats-new-in-wsl-2). 

- a bit of basic playing with [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and its [WSL2 integration](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).

- potentially the combination of these two will allow us to build some more performant dev environments for websites - faster dev environments mean less wasted time for developers
