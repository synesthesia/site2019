>Power Virtual Agent is a Low-code/No-code platform to author your chat bots but we need to embed them on websites/portals to get the most out of them. Embedding them with iframe is old-school and does not offer lot of flexibility.
In this session, we will look into how to embed them on your website/portal and customize the look-n-feel to match your website theme.
