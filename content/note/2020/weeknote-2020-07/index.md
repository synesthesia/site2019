## Kaizen

Compared to the previous week, the reverse trend - higher working hours but lower total focus hours and focus percentage.

Looking at the year to date the change from the previous week is striking.

I'm clear about the root cause. As I mentioned [last week]({{< relref "../weeknote-2020-06/index.md" >}}), we had an all-day, all-staff meeting on Wednesday. Not only did this take up almost all the day, but I found it really broke my flow in the middle of the week. On Thursday and Friday it was much harder to focus on anything requiring deep thought.

## Highlights

* Extending our automation of contact data deletion to the company website, removing a manual compliance task. 
* reviewing re-certification readiness for a security accreditation with colleague who is doing the detailed work
* writing a briefing for colleagues on how we might start podcasting
