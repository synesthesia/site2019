## Kaizen

A similar amount of time "at work" to the previous week, but a 10% drop in the amount of focused work I tracked.

{{< figure src="pomo-2020-W03.jpg" title="PomoDoneAnalysis week 2020-W03" lightbox="true" >}}

The two main causes were a non-core meeting, and losing a large chunk of time to support a colleague with a complex customer-facing issue, so no real Kaizen lessons here.

## Other highlights

**Reviewing existing Dynamics 365 customisations** to see how we would modify them to provide a new type of customer benefit (access to an external service based on job role within a B2B customer).

**Technical architecture work** to flesh out an idea to augment [customer journey tooling](https://www.thunderhead.com/) with an ability to trigger new actions 24 hours after a user last viewed our website.
