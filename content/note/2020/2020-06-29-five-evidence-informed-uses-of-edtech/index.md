>I was approached [...] to deliver a TeachMeet - I thought what better way than to share some evidence-informed approaches to using technology. [...] I have uploaded the recording of that session to Youtube.

Key points Mark makes:

* When you think about using a piece of technology for start with some basic questions to focus your intent - e.g. "So what", "So that..."
* Think about how technology will improve teaching and learning befopre you use it
* Does it Enhance learning, Support Teaching, Speed up processes? (cf SAMR model) 
* References [Understanding How We Learn](https://www.learningscientists.org/book) [^1], e.g. Retrieval Practice, Dual Coding, Elaboration, Interleaving, Concrete Examples, Spaced Practice, Interleaving
* References [Using Digital technology to Improve Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/news/new-eef-guidance-report-published-using-digital-technology-to-improve-learning/) [^2] EEF report on use of digitial technology
* References other EEF analyses on Teaching and Learning to identify high-return techniques that can be improved with technology: [Feedback](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/feedback/) and [Meta-Cognition & Self-Regulation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/meta-cognition-and-self-regulation/)
* Use technology (e.g. animations on slides) to shorten feedback loops and improve explanations / models - "explain at the point it should be explained"
* Improve impact of Retrieval Practice (ref Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve) e,g, quizzes, forms (e.g. products such as Quizziz)
* Exploit [Dual Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory) e.g. infographics
* Look for copyright free / CC graphics (e.g. thenounproject.com, PixaBay, UnSplash0
* Self Regulation - e.g. tracking screen time, calendars, DND
* Improving assessment and feedback (e.g. OneNote, Office Lens, Flipgrid)
