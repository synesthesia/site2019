Updated [Microsoft docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq) on the changes 

[Informative blog](https://survivingcrm.com/2019/09/powerapps-licenses-and-a-dynamics-365-environment/) from [Jukka Niranen](https://survivingcrm.com/about/) which in turn links to [this conversation](https://stevemordue.com/steve-has-another-chat-with-charles-lamanna/) between [Steve Mordue](https://stevemordue.com/) and Microsoft's [Charles Lamanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleslamanna/)  where Lamanna says (my emphasis): 

> So even in a Dynamics instance you can use the new per app per user license, that’s $10 for power apps, as long as you don’t use any of the restricted entities or any of the application IP, like a schedule board or something from field service. The piece of information that’s missing is that list of sales restricted entities as part of the new per app per user license, there’s a few more entities from sales that will be added to that list… I don’t have the exact list off the top of my head, but I mean the intent is exactly as you described with the list that we have. And that is to make sure that if you are using the dynamics for sales application IP, which has a whole giant engineering org working on it, then it’s only fair to pay Dynamics 365 for sales licenses or we’ll go purchase them. So it’s not going to be contact, but the ability to create an opportunity or manage opportunities, that probably should be restricted, if that makes sense
