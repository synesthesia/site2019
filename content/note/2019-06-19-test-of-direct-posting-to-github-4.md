# Test of direct posting to github

This is a test of posting from [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) directly via the GitHub api.

This uses a script action based on [this script](https://github.com/synesthesia/drafts-scripts/blob/master/scripts/post-note-to-blog.js), which in turn I adapted from based this original [idea](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/script-step-post-to-github-without-working-copy/3594) by [Paul Roub](https://github.com/paulroub);
