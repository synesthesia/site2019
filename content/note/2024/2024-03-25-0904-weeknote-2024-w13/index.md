## Listening

- not broadcast since 1981 until this week, this radio production of Pinter's [The Dumb Waiter](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001xm68) features Bob Hoskins and Roy Kinnear at their best. Part of the [Hidden Treasures](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001xltc) season. The cliche is that "radio has the best scenery", but the pared-back writing of Pinter is perfect for the medium.
