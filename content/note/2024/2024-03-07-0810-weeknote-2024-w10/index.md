## Working

Main work focus has been kicking off the implementation phase of a project that replaces the system support for a process that manages a professional accreditation we run. 

The legacy system is a very old website &mdash; we are replacing the functionality with a combination of a SharePoint site (running with external guest users) to manage all the portfolio submissions and assessment documents, controlled from a project administration application implemented as a model-driven power app in the same environment as our Dynamics CRM, the two integrated mainly with Power Automate.

## What caught my eye

- [LinkedIn Now Values Acting Like A Human At 40&#8364; Per Month](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2024/03/linkedin-now-values-acting-like-a-human-at-40e-per-month/) (Ton)
- [Teaching Information Literacy in an Age of Misinformation ](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-classroom-management/teaching-information-literacy-in-an-age-of-misinformation)
- [The Zen of Python, Unix, and LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOzxhcc1I8A)
- [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) - this looks very valuable as part of assuring the provenance of media, but transparent signing of every edit will need progress from tool vendors.

## Listening

- (irony?) a podcast on [using podcasts for learning](https://learninghack.libsyn.com/lh-77-podcasts-for-learning-with-adam-lacey)
