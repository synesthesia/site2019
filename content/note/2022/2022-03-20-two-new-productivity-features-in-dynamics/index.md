For a change, an update that isn't about cyber-security (normal service will be resumed shortly!).

The first is in-place Teams collaboration around a Dynamics record . If you are looking at either a single record or a list view of one of the selected entities (see below) then you should see this icon (insert).

Clicking that icon allows you to start a teams chat with selected colleagues about the record/view. That char is visible inside a pop up window in Dynamics and inside the Trams client.
