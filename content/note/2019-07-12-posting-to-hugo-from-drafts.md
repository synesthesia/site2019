[Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) is a genuinely useful text creation tool for iOS devices.

With the Pro version you can extend the tool with custom actions, either from the [community](http://actions.getdrafts.com), or written yourself (Javascript).

Collecting / writing / adapting useful scripts for working with this blog from my phone[here](https://github.com/synesthesia/drafts-scripts/blob/master/README.md).

To complete the setup, I recommend the [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) git client.
