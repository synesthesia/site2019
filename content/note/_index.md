This section of the site is for quick notes, usually to quickly capture the details of something I have found useful at work.

The original motivation was to experiment with what the Government Digital Service call [Make things Open: it makes things better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better).

The main benefit to me of splitting this from the main blog area is that it helps kill writer's block :-)
