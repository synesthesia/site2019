## Overview

[D365 User Group April Meeting](https://d365uguk-22-apr-2021.sessionize.com/schedule) - another all online event.

UK group are stepping away from the D356UG site because of changes of direction by the company that run it. Moving to new [Microsoft user group platform](https://community.dynamics.com/usergroup/united-kingdom-dynamics-365-user-group/) later in 2021. For now staying on [Meetup](https://meetup.com/d365ppug)

## Sessions

This time I didn't attempt to keep detailed  session notes, the recordings will be available within a few days on the [D365 Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/d365ug).

Sessions that I "attended" and which I think merit a second look are:

- [What's the deal with DataFlows?](https://d365uguk-22-apr-2021.sessionize.com/session/244190) - [Joe Griffin](https://crmchap.co.uk/)
- [Low-code platform - where do the devs fit in?](https://d365uguk-22-apr-2021.sessionize.com/session/249151) - [Matt Beard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattbeard7/) / [Malin Martnes](https://malindonosomartnes.com/)
- [Developers: Inside the plugin pipeline](https://d365uguk-22-apr-2021.sessionize.com/session/246041) - [Mark Carrington](https://markcarrington.dev/)

   lots of useful reminders, plus callouts to:
   - Jonas Rapp's [CanaryTracer](https://gist.github.com/rappen/b1aa858f0597f7cad0f6e301673a75b8) plugin
   - Daryl Lebar [Iâ€™ve Been Doing Plugin Parameters Wrong For 7 Years](https://dotnetdust.blogspot.com/2017/03/ive-been-doing-plugin-parameters-wrong.html)

As usual the [Microsoft Roadmap](https://d365uguk-22-apr-2021.sessionize.com/session/250184) session was too packed to follow in detail as [Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/) continues to grow, although useful to add [@thatguymarko](https://twitter.com/thatguymarko) / [@lucyalicebourne](https://twitter.com/lucyalicebourne) / [@anademeny](https://twitter.com/anademeny) / [@chris_haley83](https://twitter.com/chris_haley83) to follow lists if they aren't already there.

The standout things for me were:
- the release of [Robotic Process Automation (RPA)](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/robotic-process-automation/) as a free tool for Windows 10 users (free licence allows local, manually-triggered flows, [paid licences](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) needed for company-wide sharing, cloud services, access to AI etc)  - see also forthcoming [technical workshops](https://www.microsoftevents.com/profile/web/index.cfm?PKwebID=0x2117456abcd)
- the closer integration of Teams (including phone calls) within the Dynamics for Sales interface
   -  [blog post](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2021/03/02/dynamics-365-and-microsoft-teams-extend-collaboration-across-teams/)
   -  [video](https://youtu.be/SlS27nOWtsA)
   -  [install and setup Microsoft Teams integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/teams-integration/teams-install-app)

    *my experience with setting up the Dynamics365 app inside Teams is it takes a couple of goes, and you have to wait for all the permissions to sync*
- the launch of [Power FX](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/what-is-microsoft-power-fx/) - the language used in Canvas Power Apps (based on Excel) now has a name, has been open-sourced, and has the beginnings of a pro-dev source-control story too
