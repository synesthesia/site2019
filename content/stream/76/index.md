[Dr Shawn Graham](https://shawngraham.github.io/) ( @electricarchaeo@scholar.social ) runs a course on the history of the internet that takes, in his words, an "archaeological" approach to its subject. Visible from outside the course, and the thing that caught my interest, is his Connectivist approach with Students using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and Github to maintain notes, and publishing at least part of their work using a pre-configured [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) setup with a [template repository](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs).

Within the course instructions he also has some useful notes on 

- [How to read an academic article](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/3.Technical_Help/4.How%20To%20Read%20An%20Academic%20Article/)
- [How to write a precis and memo for a Source Note](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/3.Technical_Help/5.How%20to%20Write%20a%20Precis%20and%20Memo%20for%20a%20Source%20Note/)
- [Integrating Zotero with Obsidian](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/3.Technical_Help/Zotero/#importing-your-notes-from-zotero-to-obsidian)
- [importing hypothesis annotations](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/3.Technical_Help/import%20your%20hypothesis%20annotations/) 
- his [Obsidian starter](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/hist1900c-starter-vault.zip) containing the code for the Zotero and Hypothes.is integrations
- a useful [reading list](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/1.Course_Info/4.Readings/)
