Wrote up a couple of Power Automate recipes I had to spend ages to get right: [reading files from SharePoint](https://garden.synesthesia.co.uk/power-automate-read-files-from-sharepoint-directory/) and [attaching multiple files to email](https://garden.synesthesia.co.uk/power-automate-attach-files-from-sharepoint-to-email/).
