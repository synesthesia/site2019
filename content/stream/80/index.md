Forget the (slightly strange) world of how schools are managed &mdash; this quote is of general applicability in pretty much any organisation:

>Increasingly I’m convinced that observers have to view the idea of feedback as something that has to be co-constructed to have any value at all. The only feedback that matters has [to] lead to concrete actions a [person] actually takes. A [person] can’t merely receive feedback; they have to generate it themselves, taking account of the observer’s offerings
