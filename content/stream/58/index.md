It's not earth-shattering, but I'm happy to support my professional body on this.

>AI open letter to UK Government and Industry
AI is not an existential threat to humanity; it will be a transformative force for good if we get critical decisions about its development and use right.
>
>The UK can help lead the way in setting professional and technical standards in AI roles, supported by a robust code of conduct, international collaboration and fully resourced regulation.
>
>By doing so, "Coded in Britain" can become a global byword for high-quality, ethical, inclusive AI.
