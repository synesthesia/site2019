So far I have webmentions going in and out to/from my site, so at least for other people in the indieweb world that's a direct peer-to-peer mechanism to "converse between sites". I've been toying with the idea of <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a>, and that might be the most obvious use for a micro.blog  account, so for the time being have set up at [https://micro.blog/synesthesia](https://micro.blog/synesthesia). 

Biggest reservation is that I am not sure how much I want to cross-post at all - I do this for an audience of one!
