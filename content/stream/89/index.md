I've been aware of this clever tool from Mark Carrington for some time, but have not had much occasion to use it. I suspect that, in part, this is because of my relatively low experience with SQL - if I need to bulk query CDS records outside code I tend to go straight to FetchXml tools. However the recent integration of an OpenAI CoPilot is a gamechanger for users like myself as it is now trivial to create the basic queries under the data you need.
