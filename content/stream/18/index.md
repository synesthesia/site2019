A hierarchy of value-producing activities in while processing knowledge in a Digital Garden, Zettelkasten or pretty much any other way of constructing and learning from notes:

1. Reading
1. Collecting quotes
1. Creating excerpts
1. Creating Atomic Notes
1. Creating Connection
1. Creating Tools and Products

And concrete steps to improve value:

1. Identify the structures you want to build within your system. 
What would be a resource for your future self? Be deliberate and avoid all vagueness.
1. Ask yourself how your input sources can be used to improve those structures. Then use your inputs to improve those structures.
1. Repeat. You need practice. Any form of disciplined PKM is a recurring pattern that highly intelligent people who are experts in their fields can struggle with. To even write a single proper note can be a struggle if you aren’t deliberate on what will be a resource to your future self.
