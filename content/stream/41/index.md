I'm so happy to have discovered these posts by @kenshirriff@oldbytes.space - I learned about microprocessor engineering and programming using the then-current Z80, and the 8086 as featured in this series represented the excitement of the new. These products represent a time when CPU chips were comprehensible to an undergraduate (at a system block level anyway), and carry a load of nostalgia :-)
