Via [Tony Parkin](https://mastodonapp.uk/@tonyparkin/109782650802940698) I see that [Alleyn&apos;s](https://www.alleyns.org.uk/) (a fancy private school with a fancy price) has taken the bold, but probably sensible step, of [ceasing the use of written essays as homework](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/8ad20048-9ff3-11ed-be83-0b182bac2124?shareToken=27f32d1a7d23c66f3a47f39541689d1f) on the basis that the students can easily use a tool like ChatGPT to turn them in. Instead they require the students to do research in preparation for dialogue and assessment in the classroom.

How may years will it take the bodies that 'oversee' state education in the UK to allow forward-looking Headteachers to do the same thing?
