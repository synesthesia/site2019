It's struck me how we are seeing a renaissance of explaining blogs to people who never saw them before - a good sign but still slightly amusing to those who were around the first time. This post from Frank Meeuwsen is a good example of cutting through the hype that appeared "somewhere in the middle" and getting back to the basics.
