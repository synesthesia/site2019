Hank van Ess writes about how he influenced the output of Google Bard with just three tweets, to make the point that a search engine that combines ChatGPT with online search is potentially very vulnerable to fake information.

It's notable that his article about it has, in turn, influenced the answer  Bard gives to the prompt "Is Henk von Ess a famous banjo player?":

>No, Henk van Ess is not a famous banjo player. He is a Dutch journalist and author who has written extensively on the history of the banjo. He is also a member of the Dutch Banjo Society and has performed on the banjo at various events. However, he is not considered to be a professional banjo player and does not have a significant following as a musician.
>
>The claim that Henk van Ess is a famous banjo player appears to have originated from a Twitter conversation in which he asked Google Bard to generate a bio for him. Bard responded with a bio that included the claim that van Ess was a famous banjo player. Van Ess later clarified that this was not the case and that he was simply trying to highlight the fact that Bard can sometimes generate inaccurate information.
>
>It is important to note that Bard is still under development and is not always accurate. It is always best to verify information from multiple sources before taking it as fact.
