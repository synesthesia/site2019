# Mastodon social networking

---
Mastodon is a social network tool that forms part of the Fediverse.

In other words there are lots of different servers which all speak together to form a giant federated network.

*Some* of the larger servers can be seen [here](https://joinmastodon.org/servers), but as of 17/11/2022 there were over 6,000 servers in the network

---
Once you have joined a server (more on that later), you can use a wide range of tools to connect, including a web interface and a choice of mobile apps
