A collection of various software tools that I mostly put together for myself, but in the spirit of **Small Tech**

In the [words of Aral Balkan](https://ar.al/2019/03/04/small-technology/), Small Tech, 

>- Is built by humans for humans
>- Is not for profit
>- Is built by individuals and organisations without equity capital
>- Is not sponsored by Big Tech/surveillance capitalists
>- Is private by default
>- Is peer-to-peer
>- Is copyleft
>- Favours small over big, simple over complex, and modular over monolithic
>- Respects human rights, effort, and experience
>- Is human scale

I'm not sure of anything I build for myself quite reaches those lofty goals, but one has to start somewhere...
