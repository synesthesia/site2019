Most of us take notes as some part of our life, either personal or professional.

Over the summer and autumn of 2020 I have been reviewing my note-taking practices (and the technology that supports them) with the goal of reducing friction and giving myself a framework for higher-order learning.

This project note serves both documentation, by providing a place to structure how I plan to write about my experiments, and later reflection, by providing a central point to index the relevant notes.

The areas I want to cover are:

* my note-making goals
* where I started, and why change
* reinvigorating my permanent notes
* bringing together work and personal note-making practice
* where next
