**A sticky idea&#8230;**

[Howard Rheingold][1] has thrown up a new idea – [Peeragogy][2] – which has found a sticky resting place in my brain.

In a [blog post][3] written as a pre-cursor to his [2011 Regents’ Lecture at the University of California, Berkeley][4] he reflects on his experience to date with collaborative learning, and sets out the stall for his next project – to collaboratively create a guide to collaborative peer-to-peer learning:

<blockquote cite="https://dmlcentral.net/blog/howard-rheingold/toward-peeragogy">
  <p>
    I&#8217;m calling it &#8220;peeragogy.&#8221; While &#8220;paragogy&#8221; is more etymologically correct, &#8220;peeragogy&#8221; is self-explanatory. In my lecture, I&#8217;ll explain the evolution of my own pedagogy and reveal some of what I&#8217;ve discovered in the world of online self-organized learning. Then I will invite volunteers to join me in a two week hybrid of face-to-face seminars and online discussion. Can we self-organize our research, discover, summarize, and prioritize what is known through theory and practice, then propose, argue, and share a tentative resource guide for peeragogical groups? In theory, those who use our guide to pursue their own explorations can edit the guide to reflect new learning.
  </p>
</blockquote>

This idea has definitely struck a chord with me – and slightly tongue in cheek I [tweeted][5]:

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/#!/Synesthesia/status/162805877710143488">
  <p>
    Is it me, or is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23peeragogy">#peeragogy</a> about doing learning in the way a lot of &#8220;real&#8221; work is done?
  </p>
</blockquote>

**More going on**

As is so often the way, I then read further to discover that someone else had not only spotted the connection but grounded it with references. Rheingold acknowledges the work of [Joe Corneli][6] and [Charles Danoff][7], who have termed this area of study Paragogy, have co-authored a [paper][8] on it, and are [writing a book][9]. In their paper Corneli and Danoff make an explicit link between Paragogy and Peer Production.

**Relating this to technology production**

When I [tweeted][5], what I had in mind were the complex loops of idea exchange implicit in any kind of technical product development (either for external customers or internal company users):

&nbsp;
  


<div id="creately-container-gy1jxwd72-VzEoUElf2ZSTXW0IQ3mzpbBcn7M=">
</div>



Most, if not all, of these conversations imply some sort of mutual learning:

  * what sorts of things might surprise, delight or downright disappoint the customer/user
  * what sort of product and business model might work
  * what are the technical options
  * what does the industry provide
  * how can we adapt the current technology to meet the needs
  * what would we like the industry to develop next
  * and so on…..

If [the future of work is learning][10], or more bluntly [work is learning- so what][11], how can we exploit the developments in paragogical theory and practice to make such work work better?

**My questions**

it’s [turtles all the way down][12], but a few starter questions that spring to mind are:

  * does treating these processes as learning exercises lead to better performance? (and how might we measure that?)
  * what support do teams need to surface learning goals around their work?
  * what team and organisation culture will best support rapid learning?
  * how beneficial is it to make the learning explicit?

Right now this is mostly a “lightbulb” – I need to do more thinking and have some dialogue to explore further.

if any of this strikes a chord with you, please comment.
