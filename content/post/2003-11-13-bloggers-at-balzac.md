Had the hugely enjoyable experience of lunch with [Dina Mehta][1], [Flemming Funch][2] and [Julie Solheim-Roe][3]. I can report another positive example of the transfer of blog-affinity into energy-filled real-life conversations &#8211; we ploughed straight in to a whole range of topics, including:

* Do the bloggers we gravitate to have similar values?
  
* The importance of &#8220;abundance&#8221; thinking in stimulating the open sharing of ideas
  
* The way in which young Indians are completely immersed in SMS and IM, email isn&#8217;t relevant
  
* Online journals and the growing emotional openness of young men
  
* Different approaches to blog writing
  
* Blog writing as meditation
  
* Paradigm shifts in the way people inter-relate, including the growth of EBay based businesses
  
* How do we get senior generalist managers to engage with online /community software in large organisations?

In summary &#8211; a hugely enjoyable and stimulating couple of hours!
