Lots of people go for retrospective posts at this time of year, but I'm not sure I blogged frequently enough last year to really bring out the highlights. And yes I could go back through my weeknotes and daily logs, but not feeling that level of keen right now.

I missed [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) when it first came out, but it looks like people are still playing the game (some of them for the second time!)  I may as well use this as a little challenge to myself to write more on this site.

#100DaysToOffload post 1/100 !
