## Context

Following my post yesterday about  [Finding 'connectors' in Mastodon]({{< relref "../2023-03-01-0808-finding-connectors-in-mastodon/index.md">}} ), Ton Zijlstra was kind enough to [point out](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2023/03/conversational-symmetry-redux/) his 2008(!) post [Conversational Symmetry and Twitter](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2008/05/conversational_1/) in which he too was looking at followers / following ratios, only back then it was on Twitter of course.

The key to his approach is *"For me, social media ia all about conversation"*, and like my more recent look, he was looking for accounts that had a fairly balanced follow/follower ratio.

He coined a couple of more labels for people with extreme statistics:

- *Large antenna array* accounts have a very LOW `follower:follow` ratio, with a very large number of follows and few, if any, followers - these are people who Ton characerises as : *"... one on one interaction is not your goal apparantly. You’re building a phonebook, or you’re soaking up a large collage of everything that’s being posted ..."*
- *A-lister* was his term for the accounts with a very HIGH `follower:follow` ratio, the ones I called either **Just Famous** or **Broadcaster** based on how many posts they made - Ton came to a similar conclusion about these *"It’s the celebrity profile so to speak. You can use it as mass media then"*

## A heuristic for choosing people to follow on Mastodon

Combining my thoughts from yesterday with a little reflection on my current practice, and the added seasoning of Ton's thoughts re-shared, I've come up with the following [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) that I'm going to play with as a guide to my follow activity on Mastodon:

1. have a goal in mind for your use of Mastodon in so far as it relates to developing a knowledge network
2. follow promiscuously anyone who looks even slightly interesting
3. but be ready to unfollow at a whim too - let your gut be your guide
4. look at the ratio of `followers`:`followed` and the `number of posts` (aka Toots on some clients)
5. for accounts which have interesting content, a very HIGH `followers`:`followed` ratio and a reasonable number of posts (the **Broadcasters**), consider adding [the RSS feed of their account](https://garden.synesthesia.co.uk/RSS%20feeds%20from%20Mastodon#to-follow-an-account) to your feed reader, and unfollowing in Mastodon
6. for accounts which have a very HIGH `followers`:`followed` ratio and a LOW number of posts (the **Just Famous**), seriously, why bother? Cull the follow!
7. for accounts which have a very LOW `followers`:`followed` ratio (the **Large Antenna Arrays**), again why bother? 
8. for the ones that are left, engage them in conversation on anything that looks interesting - you will be pleasantly surprised how nice people are

What is your approach?
