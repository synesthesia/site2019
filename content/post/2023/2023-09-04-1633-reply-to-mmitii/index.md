Matt Ballantine makes the perceptive point that various forms of hybrid working (as in not 100% in an office all of every day) have been around for a very long time - he uses the examples of relationship-based businesses where much of the valuable connection has always taken place over coffee, or at lunch, or over a drink.



At the same time, in many jobs there are things you need to do as part of the job that just don't feel comfortable in an office (he gives the example of a a book reviewer who felt he couldn't read books in the office as it "felt like slacking").

>I’m coming to the conclusion that organisations are struggling to be able to adapt to the contemporary world of work in large part because the very skills and activities that they need people to perform we have been socialised into believing are not things we should be doing at work. &mdash; [Matt Ballantine](https://mmitii.mattballantine.com/2023/09/01/100-coffees-so-what/)
