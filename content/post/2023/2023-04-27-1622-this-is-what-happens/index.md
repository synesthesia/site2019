When you combine a couple of weeks wheere you are mostly away from the keyboard, followed by a couple of weeks of totally heads-down work delivery, mixed in with some highly significant news away from work, and a bit of minor surgery:

- no time to keep up with feeds
- no energy to have non-work ideas that are worth writing about
- no output at all on the site
