So that was Summer 2023!

Something of an absence from the online world which is not a bad thing. 

In six weeks we seem to have packed in:

- an emotionally charged week before a significant chunk of our family migrated to Canada
- a week in a fancy (but not as fancy as it thought) hotel in north-east Spain, including a "big night out" with some friends who happened to be staying in the next town along
- Covid again (from the symptoms probably the Eris variant)
- a hectic two weeks of work getting things done that had to be ready for today
- a week in a friend's apartment in southern Spain doing not very much and enjoying that

Now it's back to the 5 am alarm in the dark and the start of the grind into winter.
