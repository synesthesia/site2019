Just found Hal Macomber&#8217;s excellent [Reforming Project Management][1] blog. Some recent entries: [Story-telling Reforms the Project][2], and several entries [1][3] [2][4] [3][5] [4][6] [5][7] [6][8] [7][9] about Koskela&#8217;s and Howellls paper [The Underlying Theory of Project Management is Obsolete][10]
