Paolo Valdemarin [flags][1] two links on network organisations. The [first][2] is one I [blogged][3] back in April. The second &#8211; [orgnet.com][4] &#8211; is partly an advert for some software and services from Valdis Krebs, but has lots of links to case studies. If you follow the one about [Paul Erd&otilde;s][5] you will also find a link to a PDF of Ron Burt&#8217;s book chapter on [The Network Nature of Social Capital][6]
