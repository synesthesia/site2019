Last night went (for the first time) to a meeting of the London &#8220;cell&#8221; of <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com"  target="_blank">FastCompany</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/cof/handbook1.html" target="_blank">Company of Friends</a>. The meeting was attended by about 40 and was organised around a workshop on &#8220;Storytelling In Business&#8221; led by Tony Quinlan from Narrate Consulting. Excellent evening, both for the workshop and the networking / conversations before during and afterwards&#8230;. As always, the world is much smaller than you think.. the first person I spoke to was just two degrees of seperation away &#8211; we knew three people in common&#8230;
  
The core theme below the story-telling was &#8220;what is the vision of this group&#8221; &#8211; an idea that seemed to cause much debate, not least over having an explicit vision at all&#8230; I shall sample this one again!
