A stress management expert <a href="https://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_567545.html?menu=news.quirkies" target="_blank">wants the US to have a special day</a> when people are banned from being grumpy. She wants people to be fined for frowning and to wear special hats when they&#8217;re caught being unhappy. (via <a href="https://www.evhead.com/" target="_blank">EVHEAD</a>)
