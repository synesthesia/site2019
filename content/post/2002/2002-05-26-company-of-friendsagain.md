Unusually, the London cell had an event only a week after the previous one. This time we were treated to two hours of Adrian Gilpin talking about the basics of his &#8220;<a href="https://www.soul-power.com/about/" target="_blank">Soulpower</a>&#8221; approach to developing people&#8217;s full potential. Adrian makes no bones about the fact that his approach is derived from a wide range of influences including NLP, psychology, Covey, Buddhism and a lot more, allegedly on the basis of looking for the common themes across disciplines. The 7 themes that he chooses are Choice, Talent, Belief, Passion, Identity, Vision and Purpose.
