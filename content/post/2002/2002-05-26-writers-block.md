I think I may need to turn to <a href="https://www.garyturner.net/2002_05_01_archive.html#85103444" target="_blank">Gary Turner&#8217;s Insure-a-blog</a> service&#8230;_</p> 

> Here at Insure-a-blog our team of crack (addicted) ghostwriters are at your disposal, ready to fill that inevitable of all inevitables, the day when you have nothing worthwhile to say on your weblog. Perish the thought that such an horrific thing could ever happen to you, but ask yourself the question, could it? And if so, then what would you do? How could you face your readers? Worry no more, for a small daily fee you can insure your weblog against such a brutal eventuality. Hell, we&#8217;ll even make \**** up that whilst defying all semblance of reality will have your reader(s) believing above all conceivable belief that you are in fact a very interesting person, every day!
