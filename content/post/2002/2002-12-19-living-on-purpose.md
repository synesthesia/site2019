I met two very special people earlier this week. Beverley De-Gale and Orin Lewis are the founders of the [African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust][1]. Driven originally by the necessity of looking after their family, they have gone on to help many, many others. Not pushy, not showy, but very much people who radiate an air of being &#8220;on purpose&#8221;&#8230;
