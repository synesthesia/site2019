One of the things that&#8217;s been keeping me away from blogging over the last few months is taking some trainings in, and reading about, [Neuro Semantics][1]. More detail on Neuro-Semantics another time, but for now I&#8217;ll describe it as an extension to the NLP model of human perception.

L. Michael Hall, the thinker behind the new work has recently published a new book &#8220;The Matrix Model&#8221;. In this he extends the basic Meta-States model of &#8220;Thoughts & Feelings about Thoughts & Feelings about..&#8221; and extends it in terms of a number of directions. Critically he says&#8230; _&#8220;These processes operate as a **holarchy** rather than a hierarchy. Made out of **holons** (parts in wholes and wholes in parts), a holarchy is dynamic, moving fluid and operates with a simultaneity that makes the whole process difficult to picture&#8221;_ In this model meaning is an emergent property from the systemic interactions of the mind. Recently Hall has extended his models to start looking at cultural artefacts, considering culture as a emergent shared meaning emergent from many minds. (influenced by Searle [The Construction of Social Reality][2]
  
And this is where the serendipity comes in, because [The Obvious?][3] is considering ideas about how knowledge is created prompted by reading Stacey&#8217;s [Complex Responsive Processes in Organisations][4] _&#8220;knowledge exists and is created in the ongoing relationships between individuals and society&#8221;_
