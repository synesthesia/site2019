Nayeem Azim is a doctor. He&#8217;s also a refugee from Afghanistan. He describes how after re-qualifying to practice in the UK he has [set up an online college to train other refugee doctors.][1] After their first year they have helped 46 doctors to re-qualify to work in the UK, at an average cost of 5,000 UKP per head. Training a doctor from scratch costs ~ 250,000 UKP. He says:

> Why have we been successful?
  
> Doctors are people who want to work. They are incredibly productive and dedicated to helping society.
  
> When they became refugees, they lost a great part of their identity. For them to be sitting on benefits is utterly demoralising. So when they&#8217;re given a chance to work for the good of society, they will do
