Just found Lilia Efimova&#8217;s site [Mathemagenic][1]. Interesting selection of articles on Knowledge Management and Learning. Here are a few:
  
[Citing Styles][2], [Baking knowledge into the work processes of high-end professionals][3], [Why Blogging 2][4], [Blog as a learning tool][5], [Corporate objectives and learner-centered learning][6].

And one that struck a chord with me: [It takes courage to blog][7]
