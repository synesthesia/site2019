[Top Ten Reasons To Witness Your Dad&#8217;s Demise][1] (via [Doc Searls][2]) was written by Halley Suitt 48 hours before her father died &#8211; as she says _&#8220;here&#8217;s my attempt to see the good in these bad times&#8221;_. Reading it reminded me of my own father &#8211; he died in Jan 2000 &#8211; and just for a moment reflect on how in some ways he has been with me more often in my thoughts since he died. Since then I&#8217;ve started to notice the traits I have inherited from him, indeed as I grow into my 40&#8217;s I seem to become more like the father I remember. Here&#8217;s to fathers and sons everywhere. [updated 2002-04-10] By the way this article &#8220;[Resolving Grief][3]&#8221; by well-known NLP trainer/developer Steve Andreas describes a process that I have found tremendously useful in maintaining a good connection with my father since his death.
