Old (1998) but good [article][1] interviewing Richard Leider about living life on purpose. Leider&#8217;s guidelines:

  1. Life is a spiral. 
  2. What do you want, and how will you know when you get it?
  3. Feed the three hungers
  4. Discover the four factors of every decision
  5. Answer the ultimate question
  6. Make every job search an in-venture and an adventure
  7. Use this formula for a good career decision: T + P + E x V
  8. Live in the real world
  9. Don&#8217;t sell yourself short
 10. Find motivation from without-and from within
 11. Get advice from within-and from without
 12. Make your decisions the way senior citizens wish they had.
