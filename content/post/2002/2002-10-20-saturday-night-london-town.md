First a play:
  
[Vincent in Brixton][1] at Wyndham&#8217;s Theatre&#8230;. excellent &#8211; especially Jochum ten Haaf and Clare Higgins in the lead roles&#8230;
  
And then some music:
  
[Eric Blakely][2] at the [12 Bar Club][3]. First time I&#8217;ve seen a band at this (very) small venue &#8211; but Blakely with his Austin-based guitar/blues/country was an excellent intro to the space.
