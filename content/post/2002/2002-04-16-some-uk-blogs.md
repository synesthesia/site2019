Thought it was time to trawl through some of my compatriots &#8230; here are some that caught my eye on the way &#8230;
  
<a href="https://www.timemachinego.com/linkmachinego/" target="_blank">LinkMachineGo</a>, <a href="https://www.whereveryouare.org/weblog/"  target="_blank">Wherever You Are</a>, <a href="https://peteashton.com/" target="_blank">Pete Ashton Dot Com</a>, <a href="https://www.notsosoft.com/blog/"  target="_blank">not.so.soft</a>, [Interconnected][1], <a href="https://feelinglistless.blogspot.com/"   target="_blank">feeling listless</a>.
  
And last but not least for its very British (in)sanity <a href="https://lionelmandrake.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">A letter from the Olde Countrie</a> by &#8220;Group Captain Lionel Mandrake&#8221; (aka Steve Bail)
