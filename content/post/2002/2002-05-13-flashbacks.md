Spent this weekend in the town where I grew up. Catching up with my mother & sister, also spending some time with my kids, who were there wth my ex-wife. I took the kids to the local playground &#8211; where I too played at their age. Although some things have changed there is much as it was thirty-five years ago. Buying ice cream for them in the park cafe I had a flashback of my father buying ice cream for me in the same building.
  
I&#8217;ve been reading James Hillman&#8217;s &#8220;The Soul&#8217;s Code&#8221; which seeks to build a metaphor for life around the idea of the &#8220;acorn&#8221; &#8211; the essential purpose of each individual that is incarnated, and which, he believes, most often seen early in childhood before the layers of the world are added.
