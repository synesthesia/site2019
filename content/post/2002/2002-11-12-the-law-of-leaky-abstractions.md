The article is about software writing, but I reckon it&#8217;s generalisable to any form of technology&#8230;

> Code generation tools which pretend to abstract out something, like all abstractions, leak, and the only way to deal with the leaks competently is to learn about how the abstractions work and what they are abstracting. So the abstractions save us time working, but they don&#8217;t save us time learning.
