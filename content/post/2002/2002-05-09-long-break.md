Not been near the blog for a while &#8211; been catching up on [reading][1], been out on my <a href="http://www.ctc.org.uk" target="_blank">bike</a>, playing with <a href="http://www.python.org"  target="_blank">Python</a> and generally haven&#8217;t felt like posting&#8230;. However did notice that the Guardian has an interview with Rageboy &#8211; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4409603,00.html"   target="_blank">&#8220;Rebel without a Pause&#8221;</a>
