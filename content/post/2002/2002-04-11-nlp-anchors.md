In [wiring my mind][1] Swerdloff gives a great description of a practical application of the NLP Anchoring technique to associate a particular song with the moment of perfect beauty as he kisses his girl&#8230;

> _I have a strange question I told her. Yeah? Can I kiss you? For the duration of this song. Of course. It was only a strange question because of the song&#8230;_
