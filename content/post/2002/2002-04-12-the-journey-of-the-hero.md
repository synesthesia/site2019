<amazonlink asin="1853270482">The Journey of the Hero</amazonlink> by Fridemann Wieland. This book is about applying Joseph Campbell&#8217;s mythological idea of &#8220;The Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; to personal development, using the Grail myth as the guiding metaphor. Review to follow. This book is currently out of print, I picked up a copy for Â£1 in a remainders bookshop.
