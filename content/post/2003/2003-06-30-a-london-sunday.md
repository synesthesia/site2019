Feeling much refreshed today, thanks to a weekend that was all about forgetting work and study &#8211; and in particular a Sunday that was about celebrating some of the things that make London worth living in&#8230;

Started at [Columbia Road Flower Market][1] &#8211; although we were very much &#8220;late birds&#8221; &#8211; getting there past 11 when the place was absolutely crushed with Sunday &#8220;browsers&#8221;. But if the throng around the plant salesmen is too much you can always nip down [Ezra Street][2] to the Jones Dairy Cafe &#8211; perching on benches in an alley way scoffing bagels stuffed full of smoked salmon and their home-produced cream cheese washed down with half pint mugs of tea or fresh coffee. Bliss!

Shopping complete there was an overwhelming consenus that a drink by the river was absolutely necessary &#8211; so a chance to explore yet another part of towm I&#8217;ve never been before and enjoy a very fine pint of [Youngs][3] bitter at the [Prospect of Whitby][4] in Wapping.
