[Jim McGee][1] is asking [Is Knowledge work improvable?][2]. He contrasts the <q cite="https://www.gurustrategic.com/pdf/Knowledge-Net.pdf">&#8220;organic&#8221;</q> approach of <q cite="https://www.gurustrategic.com/pdf/Knowledge-Net.pdf">&#8220;knowledge-enablers&#8221;</q> [espoused][3] by [Kim Sbarcea][4] and others with [Taylorism][5]. Sbarcea attacks the Taylorist, &#8220;command and control&#8221; approach to KM, but McGee rebuts with <q cite="https://www.mcgeesmusings.net/2003/02/06.html#a2955">&#8220;it is a mistake to confound the issue of what to call knowledge management with objections to Taylorism.&#8221;</q>
  
McGee goes on to [link in][6] thoughts triggered by Peter Drucker&#8217;s 1999 article &#8220;Knowledge-Worker Productivity: The Biggest Challenge.&#8221; and identifies that knowledge work is a process replete with feedback loops.

In a similar head-space, [excited utterances][7] points to [Metrics for CM and KM][8] by [James Robertson][9]

My instinct is that all of these approaches are useful, especially if you can apply them synergistically. The key, I believe, is good stakeholder analysis around the relevant knowledge-work process, asking questions such as:

  * Who are the groups affected by this process? 
  * What values do they associate with the work and it&#8217;s outcomes?
  * What do they need to see from &#8220;improvements&#8221; to convince them the change is worthwhile?

For example, whilst the management who are investing in systems, tools, training etc. will want to see metrics that show a hard ROI, the practitioners and their immediate &#8220;customers&#8221; might be more concerned about how it helps them solve problems, or whether their knowledge contributions and expertise are recognised&#8230;
