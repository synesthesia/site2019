[The Shifted Librarian][1] points to [Zempt][2] &#8211; a multi-platform (so far Windows but Linux and Mac planned) tool for posting to multiple [Moveable Type][3] blogs. In my situation where I have three personal blogs (main page, library, linkblog) plus two corporate ones inside the firewall this could be a real boon. Key features:

>   * Intuitive, easy-to-use interface 
>   * Post entries to your Movable Type blog 
>   * Full support for Movable Type entry fields including: 
>       * Title 
>       * Body 
>       * Extended Entry 
>       * Excerpt 
>       * Keywords 
>   * Multiple categories 
>   * Comment Status 
>   * TrackBack status 
>   * Send TrackBack pings 
>   * Edit entry date and time 
>   * Easy text and paragraph markup. Add bold, links, blockquotes, and paragraph alignment quickly and easily. 
>   * Preview your posts 
>   * Save posts as draft 
>   * Manage multiple blogs on multiple sites 
>   * Spell-checker

And if you can see this it works!
