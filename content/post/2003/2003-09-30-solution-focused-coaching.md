I went to a seminar last week on this topic given by Harvey Ratner from the [Brief Consultancy][1].

Solution-focused Coaching is the application of the [Solution-focused Brief Therapy][2] approach to coaching. In outline the approach seems to be:

* Elicit client&#8217;s &#8220;best hopes&#8221; for the meeting
  
* Elicit client&#8217;s ideal future
  
* Identify signs that progress has been made already
  
* Calibrate where the client thinks he/she is and what would be needed to make an incremental improvement

the whole thing infused with lots of positive feedback about what is working, a constant drawing-out of sensory descriptions of the desired state, an exploration of different perceptual positions and an underlying assumption that the client will develop his/her own detailed action plans&#8230;

One of the key differences from other approaches seems to be the future bias &#8211; in NLP terms a lot of focus on helping the client build a really strong representation of the &#8220;Desired State&#8221; (DS), combined with &#8220;ecology&#8221; checks, exploration of different perceptual positions and lots of reinforcement of the client&#8217;s resources. 

I would tend to do most of that in my normal coaching approach but I would also spend time exploring the current state (CS) and why it was persistent &#8211; looking for ways to loosen the &#8220;stuckness&#8221;. When another participant asked about this Harvey&#8217;s response was that from a solution-focused point of view any time spent talking about &#8220;now&#8221; rather than &#8220;then&#8221; tended to strengthen the hold of the past/present&#8230;

During the seminar we did a couple of exercises, one of which was related to the &#8220;calibration&#8221; stage &#8211; a very simple question &#8220;thinking about your job, and your ideal situation, where would you say you had got to on a scale of 0 &#8211; 10&#8221; [&#8230;] &#8220;and what tells you that you are that point and not a 0?&#8221; [&#8230;] &#8220;and what do others see you doing that contributes to you being at that point?&#8221; (of course the skill is in the way the questioner asks the questions and especially in the way they keep going to elicit more and more&#8230;)

Being on the receiving end of that questioning (even though I &#8220;knew&#8221; it was &#8220;just&#8221; an exercise) I was surprised by the sense of momentum and energy that was created in me by an in-depth appraisal of all the good things I have already achieved. 

I can see how that energy focuses the mind so that the &#8220;and what would you have to do to just add one point on the scale?&#8221; questions trigger &#8220;it&#8217;s obvious&#8230;&#8221; answers from the client, perhaps also how that energy combined with the &#8220;pull&#8221; of a clear desired future would be enough to unstick from the power of the past. I&#8217;m very tempted to take a training in the approach, certainly I shall spend some time reflecting how I can usefully strengthen my coaching with what I&#8217;ve learned. 

Whilst musing about that sudden rush of energy I was also reminded of the [Appreciative Inquiry][3] approach to organisational change &#8211; again that focuses on what already works with a team, in an organisation, as a prelude to moving on to even better things &#8211; on the surface the parallels seem obvious, but I need to think a bit more about whether there might be an underlying model that could explain both&#8230;
