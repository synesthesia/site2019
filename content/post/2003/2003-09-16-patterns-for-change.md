[Lilia Efimova][1] [points][2] to [Introducing New Ideas Into Organisations][3], in particular the [collection of patterns][4] [PDF, 454 kB].

This is 123 pages, so I&#8217;ve only just started to work through it, but on first reading it&#8217;s fascinating &#8211; you know the &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moment when someone codifies stuff that you&#8217;ve been doing intuitively&#8230; 

Certainly I recognised many patterns here as things I and others have learned the hard way as ways of introducing our ideas into the daily life of the organisations we work with &#8211; and I think many of us will also be able to learn from it.

The patterns are grouped into the following categories:

* Roles
  
* Events
  
* Keeping the Idea Visible
  
* Dealing with Sceptics
  
* Early Activities
  
* Reaching Out
  
* Convincing Others
  
* Teaching and Learning the Idea
  
* Long-term activities

I&#8217;m sure this will be a great resource for coaching &#8211; an inherent assumption of the NLP approach is that if you can identifiy the patterns under a successful piece of behaviour you can teach it to others.
