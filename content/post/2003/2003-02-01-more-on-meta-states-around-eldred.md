In an [earlier article][1] I noted the idea of exploring the cultural models operating on the opposite sides of the Eldred dispute. Progress update- have got as far as creating a [Wiki page][2] to capture my thinking on this, and have populated it with an outline of the approach, condensed from several pages of the training manual from the last [NeuroSemantics][3] course&#8230; 

Since it&#8217;s a Wiki, [feel free to contribute][4]!
