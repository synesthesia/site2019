As per a [previous entry][1] I&#8217;ve started playing with these technologies as a way of interfacing between [MindManager][2] and arbitrary document formats. On the way I&#8217;ve found an excellent freeware [editor][3]. Debugging [XPATH][4] statements to understand why the latest &#8220;<xsl:apply-templates select =&#8221; hasn&#8217;t selected what I thought it would is a real &#8220;refresher&#8221; for the logical parts of the mind!
