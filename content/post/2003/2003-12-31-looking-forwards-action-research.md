[Ton][1] points to this [free course][2] on [Action Research][3]

I&#8217;ve looked at the course notes and they&#8217;re very impressive. Reading [What is Action Research?][4] I realised that an awful lot of what I do in my work loosely follows this model &#8211; no two projects are quite alike. Inevitably in a work environment, the focus is always on the &#8220;action&#8221; part of the cycle &#8211; not for the first time I&#8217;m thinking that more emphasis on reflection would be useful&#8230;

So what might I like to get from studying this course?

* A theoretical model to put a context around my project-based learning at work
  
* Practical tools to help me build in reflective thinking
  
* An opportunity to see if I can focus on a topic long enough for anything more than a shallow understanding (!)
  
* An opportunity to practice existing skills

Although mindful of [Lilia][5]&#8216;s [warning][6] about the time involved I have emailed asking to sign up for the full (and still free!) email version of the course in February.
