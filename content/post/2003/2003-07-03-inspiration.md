[Euan][1] [points][2] to a motivating quote by [Jack Ricchiuto][3] :

bq. In our communities of work, trade, life, faith, and practice, we need to have conversations about what we most deeply care about as we form karmic images of our personal and collaborative futures. We need to inspire one another in ways never thought possible before. We gain nothing by pretending we lack this power. We gain everything by honoring it.

I found the Rilke quote powerful too:

bq. You must give birth to your images. They are the future waiting to be born. Fear not the uncertainty you feel; the future must enter you long before it happens
