I&#8217;m indebted to my colleague (and coaching supervisor) Jenny Mitchell \_(no online reference available)\_ who, after reading my earlier [article][1] on Solution-focused Coaching has sent me a large stack of references and related reading:

* [Harry Enfield, Hamlet and the Solutions Focus][2]

* [A Comparison of Appreciative Inquiry and Solutions Focus][3]

* [The Solutions Focus: Keeping It SIMPLE In The Learning Organisation][4]

* [Solution focused Corporate Coaching][5] \_[HTML converson from Word via Google]\_

* [Classic Models &#8211; Solution-Focused Coaching][6]

* &#8220;Solutions-focus and the five messages of the Schn√§pper&#8221; by Peter Szabo \_[no online version found]\_

Also Mark McKergow, author of several of the articles listed above commented on my earlier [entry][1] flagging up his [web site][7] and book <amazonlink asin="1857882709">The Solutions Focus: The SIMPLE Way To Positive Change</amazonlink> (haven&#8217;t read the book yet so can&#8217;t comment on it&#8230;)
