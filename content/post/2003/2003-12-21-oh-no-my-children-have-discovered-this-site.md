The day had to come of course, when the huge interconnectedness of the web comes back to a place that is some way away in the physical world, but right inside me as far as my emotions are concerned&#8230;

That&#8217;s right, my children have discovered this site!

Luckily, unlike many who write more personal journals on the web &#8211; and then go through all sorts of inner twisting when people they know in real life start reading &#8211; I have always kept this blog focused on things which appeal to me intellectually &#8211; sometimes work related; sometimes not &#8211; but always both &#8220;work safe&#8221; and &#8220;family safe&#8221;.

Nevertheless it&#8217;s a strange feeling! 

On balance I&#8217;m pleased. These writings and conversations are part of me, and it feels good to know that maybe it will open up new conversations with my children about the world they are growing up in. 

Mind you at the moment my daughter thinks it&#8217;s &#8220;uncool&#8221; &#8211; which I hope is just a reaction to my photo ðŸ™‚ Perhaps the Christmas project will be showing her how to set up her own site!
