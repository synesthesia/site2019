It&#8217;s tempting to quote [Ton][1] and explain away my break from blogging as a period of attending to &#8220;[the mundane task of broadening the base of [my] knowledge pyramid][2]&#8220;. Perhaps true on one level or another but also a period of being very busy with work and generally enjoying the outdoors rather than being in front of the computer&#8230;

In terms of reading, as usual I have had several books on the go at once, but the one that seems to have kept its presence in my work bag for those snatches of reading-catchup on the Tube has been [Guns, Germs and Steel][3]

With my &#8220;work hat&#8221; on I&#8217;ve been filling up my research time reading around topics such as [Agile Modelling][4] and [QFD for Software Development][5]

Cultural highlight of the last month has to be my first visit, last Saturday, to [Shakespeare&#8217;s Globe][6], to see &#8220;Dido, Queen of Carthage&#8221;. If you are not familiar with this reconstruction of what the original Globe theatre is believed to have looked like, one of the most striking features is &#8220;the Yard&#8221; &#8211; basically if you are prepared to stand for the whole production you get the best view in the house _and_ the cheapest tickets. As a &#8220;Groundling&#8221; you get a great sense of engagement with the actors, you can almost touch them if you go right to the front&#8230; And it&#8217;s from that vantage that you begin to get a real sense of the dynamic interaction between the players (this isn&#8217;t a recording it&#8217;s live!) and the audience. Addictive (and affordable) stuff, now checking out when to see the other four plays in this season!
