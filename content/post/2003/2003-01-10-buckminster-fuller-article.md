[Internet Time Blog][1] has an interesting [article][2] on Buckminster Fuller, including links to his work online, based on a talk by [Bonnie DeVarco][3]. Fuller is one of those people &#8220;we&#8217;ve all heard of&#8221;, yet I&#8217;ve never read his work. A quick taste of the links, plus Bonnie&#8217;s reported summary:

> **Characterizations of the man**
  
> Leonardo da Vinci of the 20th Century
  
> Poet of Industrialization
  
> Engineer Saint
  
> Anti-academician
  
> I Seem to be a Verb
  
> I am a random element.
  
> I am a comprehensive anticipatory design scientist. 
> 
> **His thinking**
  
> Micro-incisive and macro-inclusive
  
> Nothing is static; everything is dynamic
  
> The importance of charting trends
  
> Being comprehensive rather than general
  
> The importance of thinking out loud
  
> The importance of INTUITION
  
> Dare to be naïve
> 
> **Among his paradigms**
  
> Newtonian to Einsteinian universe
  
> Wired to wireless
  
> Ephemeralization of information
  
> Accelerating acceleration 

have convinced me I need to add to my reading list&#8230;
