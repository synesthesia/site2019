[Gary Turner][1] is [writing][2] about what he&#8217;s learned from blogging. Rather than try to extract sensibly here, I suggest you read it&#8230;

His post struck a chord with me &#8211; my response (adapted from the comment I posted over at Gary&#8217;s) was something like this&#8230;

I have a tendency to see links between ideas from totally disparate fields (or fields that are totally disparate according to our subject-driven way of categorising knowledge) &#8211; that&#8217;s the way my mind seems to work. I used to think that was &#8220;just&#8221; my way of making sense of things, and previously I&#8217;ve been exposed to comments from &#8220;domain experts&#8221; that suggest that I&#8217;m only seeing links because I don&#8217;t &#8220;really understand the depth of the subject&#8221;. In fairness, I have never claimed &#8220;academic rigour&#8221; for what I think &#8211; I have a more pragmatic approach. As I&#8217;ve grown older though I have become more confident that these syntheses are valid knowledge in their own right &#8211; one of the pleasures I&#8217;ve found from blogging is when occasional others have said the same thing.

As I said, my approach (and from the sound of it Gary&#8217;s too) has a heavy element of pragmatism &#8211; when I&#8217;ve stumbled upon a nugget of thought I&#8217;ll tend to just go off and use it out in the world. (the sort of engineering creativity [JT][3] refers to in the comments to Gary&#8217;s post). The spirit of innovation and creativity moulds and shapes it&#8217;s own working models as it goes &#8211; if you find a blockage work around it, or take a sidestep to a different path that leads to the goal.

What I&#8217;ve tended not to be so hot on is an explicit linking those ideas and the results of their application to the next thing &#8211; that&#8217;s another reason I blog &#8211; to try and capture the long-form development of my thinking which is normally inarticulate in the pressure of here-and-now, to make explicit my own tacit knowledge, and by contrasting it with others&#8217; thoughts find even more ways to move on&#8230;

Are we all prisoners of our own success? The sorts of thinking Gary and I are describing have stuck with us because they work for us in the situations we find ourselves in. Recognising those patterns is the first step to changing them &#8211; the blog helps to do that because it extends our time horizon.
