[Ton][1] has [added photos][2] to his blogroll. I wondered if he was doing it by searching people&#8217;s <acronym title="Friend Of A Friend: An RDF vocabulary for describing social networks">FOAF</acronym> files but apparently not (it was pure coincidence that he added my photo about a day after I linked it from [my FOAF][3] file)
