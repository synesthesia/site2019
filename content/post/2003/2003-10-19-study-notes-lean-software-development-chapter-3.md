Continuing to work through [Lean Software Development][1] by Mary & Tom Poppendieck.

\*Chapter 3 &#8211; Decide As Late As Possible\*

* Concurrent development &#8211; the importance of both knowledge and collaboration.
  
* Cost escalation curves for changes &#8211; the old &#8220;exponential&#8221; model for increasing cost of late change really only applies to critical constraints (e.g. major technical architecture decisions)
  
* Use &#8220;breadth first&#8221; approach for the major constraints &#8211; for other aspects defer decision as long as possible through iterative development
  
* Importance of keeping options open until &#8220;last responsible moment&#8221;
  
* Share information early &#8211; don&#8217;t wait for it to be &#8220;complete&#8221;
  
* Direct worker-to-worker collaboration
  
* Learn how to deal with change
  
* Breadth-first decision making works best when business domain is evolving
  
* Simple rules allow robust and flexible response to real-world variation
