As I&#8217;ve noted before, my blogging seems to be in inverse proportion to sunlight &#8211; the last few weeks have been a fabulous spring here in South East England so I&#8217;ve found myself losing interest in scouring the network for things to comment on. That, plus catching up with friends, [playing][1] on a new [bike][2], and a couple of events I&#8217;ll blog about later&#8230;

But now the UK seems to have returned to Winter again, at least for a while, so maybe I&#8217;ll catch up on some things!
