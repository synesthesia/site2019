[Phil Wolff][1] is wondering [Can you apply Theory of Constraints to Human Capital?][2]. 

Interesting questions &#8211; although the term &#8220;Human Capital&#8221; makes me cringe slightly&#8230; <ins>(Update &#8211; David Gurteen seems to have the <a href="http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/0/4E981D1E0F1010AF80256D29002FF160/">same reaction</a> to these labels too!)</ins> However in the context of workforce planning one of his questions seems to go to a pretty core issue <q>&#8220;How can we [&#8230;] spend more time spent in meaningful conversation and less on paperwork?&#8221;</q>
