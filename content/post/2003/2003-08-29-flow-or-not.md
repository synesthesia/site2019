It&#8217;s raining so it must be time to start blogging again&#8230; ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;ve been wondering (yet again) about the importance of going with what feels right, the natural flow, and acknowledging your own energy level (or lack of it&#8230;)

In the last two weeks I&#8217;ve: 

* thoroughly enjoyed a long weekend in Paris (photos to follow when I remember to send off the film &#8211; you do remember film don&#8217;t you?)

* had an activity-filled week at home in London with my children

* two manic days of meetings at work

* helped a colleague celebrate his 50th in the traditional manner

&#8230;yet for some reason this morning, as I sat staring at my PC trying to get back into the flow of writing a document I started three weeks ago I couldn&#8217;t understand why my thoughts weren&#8217;t coming &#8211; just how out-of-touch do you have to be to not realise that you&#8217;re tired? ðŸ™‚

Fresh air and walking about required!
