[Spike Hall][1] is thinking about [Knowledge-making][2] and distinguishes between personal knowledge and universal knowledge:

> Take learning to ride a bike, for example; [&#8230;] at the end the learner can do more [&#8230;] and has, therefore, &#8216;made knowledge&#8217;. But it&#8217;s not knowlege-making in the universal sense. The universal sense applies when our new knowledge is also [provably, arguably] new for EVERYBODY. Claims for knowledge-making in the universal sense are addressed in the academic and scientific literature. 

I suggest that this universal knowledge is a facet of what General Semanticists would call <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;q=%22general+semantics%22+time%2Dbinding" target="_blank">time-binding</a>, the ability of human beings to learn from prior generations. He continues:

> The pursuit of a bit of universal knowledge won&#8217;t be unlike the pursuit of personal knowledge; the quest, before it ends, will , however, be more rigorous. This would be so first because establishing its newness in a universal sense has one communicating, explaining, demonstrating to a broad audience. Those that are skeptical about its newness or it&#8217;s utility in the environment to which it will apply (remember the equilibrium between individual and environment) will have to be satisfied, through reading descriptions of the inventor&#8217;s efforts of study and research, first, and her/his communication/explanation of the artifact itself, second, that it is both useful and new. 

&#8230;and goes on to wonder how weblogging relates to this 

> In my next entry I will reconstruct a nonweblogged knowledge-making experience and then I will speculate how the same effort might have been different with weblog mediation.

I&#8217;m going to speculate that the way weblogging could help this is as follows:

Communication
:   The obvious benefits of any online medium &#8211; wide visibility. The ease of update of a blog helps currency, the use of &#8220;recently updated&#8221; sites and syndication feeds helps visibility, the tendency of other bloggers to comment on things they have found also increases visibility.

Presenting antecedents and research
:   Again, any online medium offers (through hyperlinks) potentially easy access to prior art. The use of a frequently updated format such as a weblog has, by effectively publishing the research journal, potential to map out the process clearly and show where the new thoughts have been introduced.

Open dialogue
:   Through comments and trackbacks there is a visible record of discussion &#8211; challenge and response
