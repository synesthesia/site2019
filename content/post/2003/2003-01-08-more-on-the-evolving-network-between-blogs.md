Euan at [The Obvious][1] sums up his view of the &#8220;blogroll or not blogroll&#8221; debate as [&#8220;I just like following winding paths&#8221;][2]. 

At the same time [Ton Zijlstra][3] [picks up][4] on various experiments with Social Network Analysis of the blogosphere and draws the important distinction between a map based on &#8220;who knows you&#8221; &#8211; i.e. an analysis of inbound links (and I would say by implication trackbacks and comments) and a map of &#8220;who you know&#8221; based on outbound links. 

This feels time to send a request to the [Lazyweb][5] &#8211; a graphical web-based tool that takes a URL and presents some kind of graphical depiction of the incoming and outgoing networks it discovers&#8230;

**Updated** [Matt Jones][6] writes [Bridging The Bubbles][7] about similar ideas applied to finding the bridiging points between clusters of particular political (or other) views&#8230; amongst the sites he references is [Valdis Krebs&#8217;][8] analysis of booklinks on Amazon [Divided we stand? : Political patterns on the WWW][9]

**Updated again** Just found [Reputation and Conversation in Blogging and Network Topology][10] at [TIG&#8217;s Corner][11] [via [Doc Searls][12]]

**Update 3** [GoogleBrowser][13] looks like it might be part of the way there in terms of the display&#8230;. [via [Ross Mayfield][14]]
