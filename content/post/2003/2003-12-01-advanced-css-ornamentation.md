excerpt: "Literary Moose writes: 'This article is focused on techniques exploring the potential for web page decoration. To this end, I advocate the widespread use of generated content ï¿½ in my opinion the strongest and most precise tool for controlling the display where the accessible, semantic, and pure markup leaves little room for maneuverability. The most advanced techniques rely on the browser's ability to apply generated content in the form of pseudo-elements, then to apply generated content for an arbitrary element, and finally to control its flow and positioning.'"
