[Elizabeth Lane Lawley][1] [points][2] to an AP [article][3] that refers to this [project][4] on the psychological and health benefits of expressing gratitude for the good things in your life. 

The idea that there is a relationship between thoughts and health is not a new one in the NLP field. See for example the [Institute for the Advanced Studies of Health][5].

What is interesting is to see how scientists are now finding ways within the scientific paradigm to prove the existence of these effects &#8211; for example the whole field of [PsychoNeuroImmunology][6].

Coming back to the spirit of Liz&#8217;s post, in the extended entry is my own gratitude list&#8230;

* My three incredible children, who are all growing into fine human beings.
  
* All the people who love me, in whatever form.
  
* My own ability to love.
  
* Friends
  
* Having a job which stretches my talents and allows me to work with interesting people with strong values.
  
* My health.
  
* Living in a society that (mostly!) supports plurality, openness and questioning.
  
* Being able to appreciate the natural world &#8211; especially hills and woods!
