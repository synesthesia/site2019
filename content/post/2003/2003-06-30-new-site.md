If you can see this entry then you are looking at the new site for my blog &#8211; hopefully the DNS entries will propagate fairly quickly&#8230;

I&#8217;m still with the same [hosting company][1] &#8211; they are good value and are always very responsive to support calls. I&#8217;ve moved hosts from one of their older Unix accounts onto the new Linux space they are offering &#8211; faster, better control panel, more up to date features&#8230;
