As noted in an earlier [article][1] I&#8217;ve started re-reading [Overcoming Organizational Defenses][2] with the intent of seeing how to integrate Argyris&#8217;s approach with <acronym title="Theory of Constraints">TOC</acronym>.

Confirmation that my intuition may have taken me down a fruitful path comes from Chapter 1 &#8220;Puzzles&#8221;:

> &#8220;The players in these studies also take for granted policies and practices that are contrary to their managerial stewardship. They bypass root causes. They equate being realistic with being simplistic. They make all these actions undiscussable. They thus wind up creating a world in which the bad is tied up with the good so that producing the latter guarantees the former. Finally all of this is done with the best of intentions&#8221;

Which also sounds like the sort of situation a <acronym title="Current Reality Tree - one of the TOC Thinking Tools">CRT</acronym> was designed to explore!
