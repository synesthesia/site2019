Have had to take the Wiki offline as one of the scripts was causing my hosts major problems.

 <ins>updated 07/07/03 the problems were being caused in the RCSLite part of TWiki &#8211; this is an optional feature for use when RCS is not available (as it isn&#8217;t on my new host) The problem was the rdiff script which calls RCSlite &#8211; going off somewhere strange and hitting 95% processor utilisation to the understandable disgruntlement of the host company&#8230; I&#8217;m experimenting with some other wiki software, hopefully back soon&#8230; </ins>
