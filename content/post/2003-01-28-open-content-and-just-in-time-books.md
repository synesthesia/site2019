[Gary Lawrence Murphy][1] is writing about [Open Content on Prentice Hall][2] &#8211; the series that Prentice Hall are bringing out under the [Open Publication License][3]. 

Gary refers to his earlier experiences trying (unsuccessfully) to persuade Macmillan to adopt an Open Content approach to a [project][4] he was driving. The issues weren&#8217;t just with the publishers &#8211; authors had problems with a licence that wasn&#8217;t either 100% free or standard, and the publication process fell over in the middle &#8211; authors and printers were ready for XML-based document manipulation and output, but the editors in the middle were still using &#8220;their MsWord-based font-painters&#8221;

He ends with a vision for the future

  <p>
    XML-based publishing where the manuscript does not really exist, where it&#8217;s a collection of sections and variations, indexed, threaded and exported for books [&#8230;] all of it online updated on the fly by the community who uses it. The art of the author/editor would be one of filtering, pulling what they need from the knowledge base to create other titles as well, semantically linking it all through topic-maps &#8230;
