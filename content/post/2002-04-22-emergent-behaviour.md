I seem to be spending more and more time reading <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/" target="_blank">The Shifted Librarian</a> for Jenny&#8217;s insight into what is happening right now in the world of wires&#8230;. One particularly interesting current piece is <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/2002/04/22.html#a1483"  target="_blank">this</a> about how &#8220;Google boxes&#8221; are having the effect that _&#8220;two people who have never intentionally linked to each other are each generating traffic for the other&#8221;_. This is a great example of how complex behaviour can emerge from apparently simple systems&#8230;
