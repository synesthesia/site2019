  A few years ago I started a separate blog  (www.synesthesia.co.uk/msp) , primarily as a learning document whilst taking my MSP qualification.

<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
  That blog finished serving its (primarily personal) purpose over a year ago, and I feel it’s time to retire it.

<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">
  Some posts may have value, if only to myself, and I have transferred those to the <a style="color: #6472a0; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 800;" href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/blog/archives/category/mspblog/">MSP Blog</a> category on this blog.
