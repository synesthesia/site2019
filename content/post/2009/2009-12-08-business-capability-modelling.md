<ins datetime="2019-07-15">(2019-07-15) Source links seem to be broken now, however there is a new article from the same author (Leonard Greski) -  [Assessing the Value of Software Applications with Business Capability Models](https://www.architectureandgovernance.com/strategy-planning/assessing-the-value-of-software-applications-with-business-capability-models/)</ins>

I’ve just been reading a couple of articles on this topic in the online version of <a title="Link to source publication" href="https://www.architectureandgovernance.com/" target="_blank">Architecture and Governance Magazine</a>. _(registration required to read full article text)._

In <a title="Business Capability Modeling: Theory & Practice" href="https://architectureandgovernance.com/content/business-capability-modeling-theory-practice" target="_blank">Business Capability Modeling: Theory & Practice</a>, author <a title="LinkedIn profile for Leonard Greski" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/leonard-greski/2/463/930" target="_blank">Leonard Greski</a> gives a good overview of the process steps:

<blockquote cite="https://architectureandgovernance.com/content/business-capability-modeling-theory-practice">
  <p>
    Business capabilities can be modeled using a variety of simple techniques, using low-cost tools. There are four steps to create a capability model:
  </p>
  
  <ol class="decimal">
    <li>
      Develop the capability hierarchy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identify key relationships between capabilities and other planning elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Develop demand models for the capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Develop financial models for the capabilities.
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

The “how” of the approach seems to be similar to most modelling approaches – capture a hierarchical decomposition of objects and identify cross-relationships using matrices.

Of particular interest is the “what” – this approach is focused very much on identifying the characteristics of a business that create value (for customers or shareholders), and identifying the resources, investments and cashflows that underpin them. I can see this approach would be very useful in situations such as programme blueprint creation – identifying the desired future shape of the organisation.

In the second article <a title="Link to source article" href="https://www.architectureandgovernance.com/content/business-capability-modeling-building-hierarchy" target="_blank">Business Capability Modelling: Building the Hierarchy</a> Leonard dives more deeeply into the “How” of the first two steps. I look forward to reading the next article, which presumably will look at steps 3 and 4.
