Unfortunately the links to a personal instance of Wikka have not survived various hosting changes, nor can I find the source files from which I developed the architecture drawings. Ten years on I still think it is informative to think through the performance of PKM processes in terms of roles, and this is something to revisit.

Back in July Harold Jarche posted  [a useful deconstruction of the processes involved in web-based personal knowledge management][1] (PKM). Building on this, and in order to make a lot of implicit stuff in my head explicit, I&#8217;ve started developing the model into a full mapping of processes to tools.

I&#8217;ve chosen to use [Archimate][2] as a modelling language, and as I develop the model offline I will be posting views of it to pages liked from [this wiki page][3].

Harold&#8217;s model looks like this:

As I began to unpick Harold&#8217;s [seven processes][1] I realised that although they are primarily focused on &#8220;self&#8221;, one key aspect to understand them is to identify the different roles that &#8220;self&#8221; (and &#8220;others&#8221;) play. This aspect of the model so far is shown in the [Introductory View][4] :

</p>

Alongside the work of developing models for each of the processes, I began to develop a view of the [key information artefacts manipulated by the PKM processes][5].

</p>

I&#8217;ve also created pages on the wiki for the first iteration at modelling the  individual processes, linking them down to a core set of application services, and over the next couple of weeks I&#8217;ll write blog posts for those.

Comments welcome to help refine this modelling effort.
