This is the fourth post in a series of thought experiments on [applying Lean/Agile principles to the early shaping stages of a programme][1].

In the last [two][2] [posts][3] I started to explore how we could find the value stream in the “messy” stages of early programme shaping. In this post I will turn to the concept of “[waste][4]” in our context.

In the classic [Toyota Production System][5], seven types of [waste][4] are identified:

<ol class="decimal">
  <li>
    over-production
  </li>
  <li>
    idle time
  </li>
  <li>
    transportation
  </li>
  <li>
    inventory
  </li>
  <li>
    motion
  </li>
  <li>
    over-processing
  </li>
  <li>
    defective units
  </li>
</ol>

Leaning heavily on the work the [Poppendiecks][6] <span style="color: #0066cc;"></span>did to translate these concepts to software engineering, I suggest the seven types of waste for programme shaping are:

**Over-production**
:   e.g. producing documents which do not add value, and which have to be kept under configuration management

**Waiting**
:   e.g. time the team are idle waiting for decisions

**Hand-offs between groups**
:   Always an opportunity for tacit information to be lost, and the reason many organisations perceive a need for excessive organisation

**Too much work-in-progress**
:   For example creating work products long before they are needed. This &#8220;gums up the works&#8221; with documents which have to be kept under configuration management, and becomes a source of distraction

**Motion to find nee****ded information**
:   How often have you found the situation that a critical piece of information is held by one person, and that person is in another department, or another building?

**Over-refining work products**
:   e.g. Adding levels of detail or polish which do not add to the value of the document to support decisions or execution

**Defects in the work produced**
:   e.g. Plans which do not fit strategy, products which do not stakeholder expectations, or inconsistency between documents.

I&#8217;m sure that each reader will be able to add their own examples. In later posts I’ll look at possible solutions.

Next – how do we design the programme shaping process to amplify learning?
