I’ve been using variants of the [Getting Things Done (GTD)][1] technique for a few years, and I find it’s a safe haven when work is turbulent. The simple rules of the GTD workflow help create forward motion on the most overwhelming of days.

My invaluable assistant in this is [Nozbe][2] &#8211; Michael Sliwinski and his team have put together a highly-functional product that I couldn’t work without. It’s by far the most effective GTD tool I have used, and I urge you to try it. (_Disclosure – that hyperlink has an affiliate code_).

The killer features for me are:

  * easy task creation from a set of bullet points in an email – great for those post-meeting brain dumps!
  * complete integration between the web and the iPhone app
  * [Evernote][3] integration for project notes, again with an easy email interface for capturing things
  * the attitude Michael and his team have to support!

How do you Get Things Done?

Comments please!
