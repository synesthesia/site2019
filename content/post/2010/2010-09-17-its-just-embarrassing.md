…the length of time since I left this blog fallow.

It’s not as if I am not doing interesting things, far from it, I am busier than ever at work, involved in the many things that a head of IT has to get involved with in a small/medium organisation with a significant focus on web engagement and rich information-based analysis.

But that’s the problem – I am very busy doing stuff which can’t really be blogged, and I haven’t been making the time to reflect on what I am learning to the degree that can be abstracted and anonymised into a public <a class="zem_slink freebase/en/blog" title="Blog" rel="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog post</a>.

So this post is a reminder for me, a call to action about the things that I should be finding a bit of room for.

To try and get myself into the groove, I’ve started re-visiting some good posts from others about the writing habit – [these][1] from [Chris Brogan][2] are a great start.
