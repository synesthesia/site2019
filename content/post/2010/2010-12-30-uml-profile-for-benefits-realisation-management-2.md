This is a follow on from [UML Profile for Benefits Realisation Management &#8211; 1][1]. In  that post I described the basic UML profile I have created for modelling project benefits in line with [Bradley][2] and [Ward & Daniels][3]

Having started to apply the profile successfully, I wanted to extend it to model [measures][4],

These were modelled by meta-classing Class

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22926" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="brm-profile-03" src="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/brm-profile-03.gif" alt="" width="215" height="313" />][5]

As can be seen from this diagram, I have added a number of tagged values (which are modelled as attributes in the UML profile) to cover off the typical data that needs to be captured in relation to a measure.
