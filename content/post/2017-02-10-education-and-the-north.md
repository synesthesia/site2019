refernce latest on educaiton challenges in the North

childrens commisisoner and tiger parents &#8211; is it about poarentla expectation

not just the North

overall funding crisis in education

is government funding a zero sum game

long term benefit of reducing sense of exclusion v the immediate impact on london (again the zero sum game)

structural challenge &#8211; reference citi stuff

look to motivation &#8211; Osborne, Black Rock &#8211; buy cheap sell dear

is this just another way ofÂ trying to persuade the Northern voters not to go with UKIP and their pipe dreams?
