Many have written on the issues that email causes, here are some highlights:

  * Email soaks up time – e.g. McKinsey in 2012 reckoned 30% of average office worker&#8217;s week was spent [reading and answering email][1]
  * … makes people [feel they are being productive (when they are not)][2]
  * … locks up information in [silos][3] – a lot of company knowledge creation is carried out in email threads visible only to those involved, and almost impossible for anyone else to discover, leading to duplication of work,
  * <div>
      … is exclusive, with conversations only open to those who the sender sought to include
    </div>
    
      * which can lead to lower quality work, because the conversation does not necessarily include the right people
      * and which completely prevents
  * … is intrusive – when you send me an email you force my attention to your issue, interrupting my thoughts
  * … is a terrible way to share lists of actions (especially if they are buried in an email chain
  * … spawns and propagates some of the worst forms of office politics with the use of [cc and bcc][4]

Lastly, no list of the things wrong with email would be a complete without a reference to [Luis Suarez][5] and his six+ year experiment on living and working without email. A good place to start is his summary post &#8220;[Life without email – year 6, weeks 21 to 24][6]&#8220;
