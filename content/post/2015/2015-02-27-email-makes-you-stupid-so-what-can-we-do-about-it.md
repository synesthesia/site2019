Here are my notes on the highlights of what Luis and Claire think is wrong with email:

&#8220;[Email creates a dumber workforce][1]&#8221; ([3:02][2]), because ([4:02][3]) the structure of email forces an obsession with emptying the inbox without action.

[Email is a selfish tool][4] ([4:59][4]) – centred around individual, not team or company goals (because you cannot see the impact of your email on the other person&#8217;s workload).

[Email doesn&#8217;t help people focus][5] on work ([7:20][5]) – it misdirects focus and attention. Stuff just flows in, recipient is expected to filter and sort ([7:45][6]). People don&#8217;t have time, so fall back to just emptying the inbox and treating their email as a task list. This leads to [inefficiency through constant task-switching][7] ([8:10][7]).

The inefficiencies are not about the technology, but about the human behaviours it engenders ([8:58][8]).

[more and more] people justify their workload by how many emails they process ([9:22][9]) – so if we take away the email you they have nothing to do. The implication ([10:27][10]) is that [all the company knowledge, contacts, content and tasks are locked in email][10]

Email gets used as a tool for covertly managing staff ([10:45][11]) – yes some interactions need to be confidential, but most aren&#8217;t.

Knowledge is power ([11:25][12]) – share as little as possible. Which means ([12:09][13]) that [when someone leaves the company, much of the knowledge they created is lost][13].

In an increasingly-complex world, [email is no longer an effective productivity tool][14] ([12:48][14]) – nowadays the environment is complex – multi-project, multi-team, multi-geo – this means companies need open collaboration ([13:36][15]) which email cannot provide. Email has been around so long ([13:50][16]) that people are scared to try other things. [Email doesn&#8217;t engender the behaviours we need to be effective in the modern business world][17] ([15:08][17]).

Some behaviours need to be unlearned, some need to be taken from email to a new environment ([15:27][18]):

  * [Email is used to manage people in a bad way][19] ([15:40][19]), and this is getting carried through into a collaborative environment (&#8220;big brother&#8221;). Example of team who put completed work on their task list so management don&#8217;t think they have been idle.
  * Social networks expose the underlying behaviours ([17:38][20]) (ref [@hjarche][21]), and will help identify a dysfunctional corporate culture – some are threatened by this, but ([18:15][22]) it&#8217;s an opportunity to surface issues which the leadership need to tackle
  * Bad behaviour stems from leadership ([20:34][23]) – and the behaviour of leaders on social tools will determine how the rest of the company behave
  * Collaborative platforms make people accountable to each other, but allows people to expose their vulnerabilities ([21:34][24]) – which [takes courage from (especially) the senior people][25] ([22:40][25])
  * The critical importance of leadership behaviours ([24:25][26] onwards), the [importance of active engaged (and engaging) managers][27] ([26:10][27]), and [heroic leadership][28] that can expose their own flaws ([26:25][28])

Deep parallel between closed inbox mindset and static fixed job descriptions. What results is a series of blockages to the flow of work. ([27:30][29])

Collaborative environment [exposes the blocks][30], ([27:56][30]) but this leads to enquiry into the root causes of blockages, making it [about the flow of work rather than about the person][31] ([28:24][31])

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">But, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWJ_kiD2dUc?t=29m08s">if you keep evolving the process to make the work better, then the job descriptions have to keep evolving too</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/cWJ_kiD2dUc?t=29m08s">29:08</a>)<br /> </span>
