No tool is all good or all bad, so following on from &#8220;[Email – what&#8217;s wrong with it?][1]&#8220;, here are some of the reasons why it is useful: 

  * Email is almost ubiquitous 
  * … has been around a long time, so almost everyone (in a work world) knows how to use it (or [thinks][2]
			  
    [they][3] do) 
  * … allows asynchronous communication, especially with offline workers (actually so do other technologies) 
  * … is well-suited to notification-type communications 

I&#8217;ve run out of ideas – please feel free to add comments…
