As part of the site revamp, I wanted a place where I could put &#8220;<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html" target="_blank">narrating my work</a>&#8221; type posts that were outside of the main site flow &#8211; the nature of these are that they are often quick and partial, and I find having them in the main flow inhibits my writing.

The obvious place to start, was with a Custom Post Type, but unfortunately most of the things I use to write to this site (Word and the WordPress iOS app) don&#8217;t support CPTs.

A bit of digging, and I think I may have a workflow &#8211; certainly something I&#8217;m willing to try for a while:

  * writing inÂ <a href="http://fargo.io/" target="_blank">Fargo</a> &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner" target="_blank">Dave Winer</a>&#8216;s nifty in-browser outliner
  * import of posts via RSS using <a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/" target="_blank">FeedWordpress</a>, posting as a custom post type (I love that you can choose a different CPT per feed if you wish)
  * a simplified theme design for the [Working Aloud][1] area of the site

Now I just need to use it&#8230;.
