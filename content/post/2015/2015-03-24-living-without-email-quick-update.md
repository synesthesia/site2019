  A little bit about the latest "No Email" pioneering by Luis Suarez, and a simple experiment I'm doing myself

For quite some time [Luis Suarez][1] has been championing a [Life Without Email][2], not just on his [blog][2], but (amongst other places) in the [Google+ community of the same name][3].

Last month, he [announced a new community in Slack][4] around the same topic. Why two communities? As he brings out in that G+ post, while the G+ community is very much a Community of Interest, the Slack team is for those people who are both interested and driving initiatives (large or small) to reduce the inefficiencies we all suffer through an over-use of email &#8211; a [Community of Practice][5].

The nature of a practice-based community that&#8217;s working well is that people share real experiences, and I&#8217;m reticent to copy even my own stuff verbatim. If you are interested, Luis opens the group to all &#8211; although as he says with a true sense of irony, he needs an email address to let people in! See the [G+ post for more information][4].

One minor experiment of my own that I&#8217;m happy to share, as a quick test of how well it&#8217;s going, has been to leave Outlook closed this week. I&#8217;ve been aiming to only use webmail and web calendar &#8211; and so far it&#8217;s working OK &#8211; I&#8217;ve also noticed that my browser tabs for SharePoint, Yammer and the other services I use during my working day have been open far more often than the mail tabs.

A long way from the sort of metrics that would be needed at an organisation level, but nevertheless a good quick test&#8230;
