Fargo is an outliner in the cloud

Uses Dropbox for data persistence

You can publish a document as a web site via [smallpict.com][1]

I&#8217;m using FeedPress to insert the RSS feed of the published site as custom post types in my WordPress site

Have set up through workflow that publishes on my site

TODO investigate [Fargo Publisher][2] &#8211; does this potentially let me run the toolchain independently of the (generously, free) service at Small Picture?

See [this][3]
