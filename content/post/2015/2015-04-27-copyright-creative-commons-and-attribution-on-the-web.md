_Some colleagues were asking about Creative Commons, so I pulled together these notes. I am not a lawyer, and this post is based on a brief overview of published sources. Do not rely on this information as a substitute for legal advice_

[Copyright][1] <span style="color: black;">is a broad term covering the legal protections given to the creators of written and other work, allowing them the sole right to reproduce or exploit the work for a set period, after which the work transfers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>. Philosophically it is a trade-off between allowing individuals or companies to profit from their ideas, whilst ensuring that eventually ideas become part of the intellectual and cultural commons from which all humanity benefits, and thus ensuring that in the long run there is general progress in the &#8220;sciences and arts&#8221;.<br /> </span>

<span style="color: black;">In 2014 a number of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-copyright-law">changes were introduced to English law</a> to clarify the &#8220;fair use&#8221; provisions, and to extend the law to treat digital media in a manner consistent with older forms in which copyright work are expressed. Nevertheless, the position remains that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/copyright/overview">the majority of uses of copyright materials continue to require permission from copyright owners</a>.<br /> </span>

<span style="color: black;">After a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft">landmark legal case</a> in the USA that retrospectively extended the term of copyrights by 20 years, Stanford Law School (now Harvard) professor Lawrence Lessig published &#8220;<a href="https://www.free-culture.cc/"><span style="color: #252525; font-size: 10pt; background-color: white;"><em>Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity</em></span></a>&#8220;.<br /> </span>

<span style="color: black;">The core argument of the book was that as large media corporations used their political and financial muscle to lobby for ever-longer copyright periods, and lock down media with anti-copying technology, they were increasing their profits at the expense of cultural freedom and the future creativity of the USA.<br /> </span>

<span style="color: black;">At about the same time, the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/history">Creative Commons Foundation</a> started to create new forms of copyright licences that creators could choose to apply to their work. These new licences allow the creator of a work to choose exactly which copyright protections they wish to retain, and which they wish to set aside, in the interests of a wider usability of their work. The vision of Creative Commons is:<br /> </span>

> <span style="color: black;"><em>&#8220;realizing the full potential of the Internet — universal access to research and education, full participation in culture — to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity&#8221;<br /> </em></span><span style="color: #595959; font-size: 9pt;">From <<a href="https://creativecommons.org/about">https://creativecommons.org/about</a>><br /> </span>

<span style="color: black;">The main protections that <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons (CC) licences</a> allow creators to release or keep, as they choose, are:<br /> </span>
