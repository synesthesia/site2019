[Dave Pollard][1] has written about [the psychology of information, or why we don&#8217;t share stuff][2], the organisational and human factors that impede knowledge-sharing:

<blockquote cite="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2005/09/19.html#a1278">
  <ol>
    <li>
      Bad news rarely travels upwards in organizations
    </li>
    <li>
      People share information generously peer-to-peer, but begrudgingly upwards, and sparingly downwards in organizational hierarchies.
    </li>
    <li>
      People find it easier and more satisfying to reinvent the wheel.
    </li>
    <li>
      People only accept and internalize information that fits with their mental models and frames.
    </li>
    <li>
      People cannot readily differentiate useful information from useless information.
    </li>
    <li>
      The true cost of acquiring information and the cost of not knowing are both greatly underestimated in most organizations.
    </li>
    <li>
      People know more than they can tell, and tell more than they can write down.
    </li>
    <li>
      People can internalize information presented graphically more easily and fully than information presented as text, and understand information conveyed through stories better than information presented analytically.
    </li>
    <li>
      Most people want their friends, and even people they don&#8217;t know, to succeed, and people they dislike to fail and this has a bearing on their information-sharing behaviour.
    </li>
    <li>
      People are averse to sharing information orally, and even more averse to sharing it in written form, if they perceive any risk of it being misused or misinterpreted.
    </li>
    <li>
      People are generally reluctant to admit they don&#8217;t know, or don&#8217;t understand, something.
    </li>
    <li>
      People don&#8217;t take care of shared information resources.
    </li>
    <li>
      In some organizations, internal competition mitigates against open sharing of information.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some modest people underestimate the value of what they know.
    </li>
    <li>
      We all learn differently.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rewards for sharing knowledge don&#8217;t work.
    </li>
  </ol>

The point, of course, being that it&#8217;s almost nothing to do with the technology.

At almost the same time, [David Weinberger][3] has published an [article][4] in [KM World][5] about the impact of the social software tools that [Euan][6] has managed to sneak in &#8220;under the radar&#8221;&#8230; where again the emphasis has been on using the lightest-possible technology to support conversations.

Interesting juxtaposition.
