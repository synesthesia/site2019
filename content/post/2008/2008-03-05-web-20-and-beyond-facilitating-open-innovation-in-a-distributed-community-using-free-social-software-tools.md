Iâ€™m at [Web 2.0 and Beyond &#8211; Applying Social and Collaborative Tools To Business][1]

**Facilitating Open Innovation in A Distributed Community Using Free Social Software Tools**

[Claire Reddington][2], [iShed][3] & Ed Mitchell, [Ed Mitchell Consulting][4]

iShed is spin off from Watershed media centre in Bristol, to bring together media and R&D &#8211; investing in 6 SMEs to research into media blue sky stuff &#8211; including Aardman Animations.

Have used project blogs etc. for years. This time wanted to do something different.

Media Sandbox &#8211; looking at pervasive media &#8211; want to create a commmunity of interest and support a community of practice.

Quoted [Charles Leadbetter][5]

Three year project &#8211; three times one year. Want to learn and adapt.

Blogs, mailing lists, 3rd party apps like flickr, physical gatherings, workshops etc.

Preparation, launch event, open innovation, progress and final results&#8230;

Collaborative R&D with small SMEs is a big thing &#8211; they find it hard to make space to do this blue sky thinking.

By the community for the community &#8211; the media community helped shape the criteria for grant award

Question they posed &#8211; how can this online stuff help us measure (various success criteria)
