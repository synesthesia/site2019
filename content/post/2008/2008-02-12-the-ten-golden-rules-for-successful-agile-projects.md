I’m blogging the conference [Agile Approaches for Delivering Business Value][1]

**The Ten Golden Rules for Successful Agile Projects
  
** _Keith Richards, [Keith Richards Consulting][2]_

**Summary**

  * Agile approaches to projects are maturing and becoming mainstream, yet some are more successful than others
  * This presentation describes the ten golden rules that will increase the chances of success, and make the difference between an &#8220;OK&#8221; project and an &#8220;excellent&#8221; project.
  * The golden rules also highlight what NOT to do.

**Speaker**

**The Golden Rules**

No survey – just first hand experience…

<ol class="decimal">
  <li>
    Define the project objective in less than 10 words
  </li>
  <li>
    Build a team with those who say “can”
  </li>
  <li>
    Go slow early to go fast later
  </li>
  <li>
    Look backwards to go forwards
  </li>
  <li>
    Change is great!
  </li>
  <li>
    To be understood, seek first to understand
  </li>
  <li>
    Collect actuals – “oxygen” for your project
  </li>
  <li>
    Use fat communication channels
  </li>
  <li>
    Work hard at controlling what you can’t control
  </li>
  <li>
    One more day? NO! We&#8217;ll catch up NO!
  </li>
</ol>

If you can’t understand the rationale for doing a project you shouldn’t be doing it! Expect to spend half a day writing the <10 words.

Good people above good process – in fact good people more important than that they have the skills. Test: ask “Can I ask a favour?”

How much design up front (DUF) is enough? Answer: Enough! But try and avoid grabbing early at solutions. Test: “Is it safe to move on?”

ALWAYS have project reviews! [Kaizen][4] is vital.

Embrace change… How do you feel when the customer changes their mind? Should be happy! Change to get a closer fit to the business need (depth change) is good – change in breadth might be a problem&#8230; (signals possible issue with project objective)

Facilitation and influencing skills are core competencies for Agile projects – especially for the project manager. Try the 10 second silence when getting a progress update!

Measuring actuals – start now, start simple, start using to calibrate your estimates…

Communication – go visual, use workshops, never write when you can talk…

Continuously manage external risks – be “a bit of a worrier” – actively manage your risk log!

Time focus is your greatest weapon. Force the issue – timeboxes, not milestones. If you are going to fail, fail early. Never extend deadlines.
