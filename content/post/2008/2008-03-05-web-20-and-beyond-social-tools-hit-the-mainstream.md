**Social Tools Hit The Mainstream**

Lee Bryant, [Headshift][2]

Ideas behind social tools now ready to challenge lots of existing IT and Internal Communications practices inside organisations &#8211; Tim O&#8217;Reilly

The social stack:

  * Personal tools &#8211; organise your &#8220;stuff&#8221; by tags- personal portals, manage networks and feeds.
  * Group Collaboration &#8211; wikis and group systems
  * Blogs and networks
  * Bookmarks and Tags
  * Public feeds and flows

Proven benefits:

  * Simpler, smarter, cheaper enterprise computing.
  * Better personal productivity &#8211; move stuff email that doesn&#8217;t need to be in it, social network as information filter, better findability.
  * Network productivity and presence sharing &#8211; &#8220;flow&#8221;formal
  * Better informal collaboration and sharing
  * Collaboration and networking &#8211; including with other businesses you are partnering with
  * Open innovation
  * Internal communications &#8211; more interactive engagement, combination of tools and media two-way not just broadcast.
  * Recruiting and retaining emergent talent &#8211; the &#8220;digital native&#8221; expect to participate. Many of their IT skills being wasted by forcing them into traditional IT environment.
  * In-context, continual informal learning

Success factors:

  * Start with small, simple self-powered projects.
  * Create conditions for shared meaning e.g. a shared del.icio.us account &#8211; share social objects

Challenges

  * Enterprise IT sucks badly &#8211; IT industry still centralising, internet is about intelligence at the edges.
  * Try to put IT in the hands of the users &#8211; IT governance processes can slow things down so much that costs can be an order of magnitude higher.
  * Moving from .doc and email to the wiki way
  * Iterative approach, agile development. Get something done, expose it to users, adapt to feedback.
  * Enterprise Information Architecture &#8211; moving away from _a priori_ taxonomies to folksonomies. Individual tagging actions lead to collective benefit.
  * Information Professional become network nodes.
  * Support the early adopters, but avoid it being a geek ghetto. Make more intimate collaboration environments. Everything needs to be based on a real-world use case. Think of the web as an innovation lab.

Three Myths

  * Social Networking is a waste of time &#8211; recognise that online life is distributed, don&#8217;t cut it off when they come through the door.
  * New security risks? &#8211; yes, but the old ones are worse, because people work around bad old unusable IT
  * Sharing is dangerous? We cannot stem the tide of sharing &#8211; better to teach responsibility than police use
