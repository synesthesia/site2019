Iâ€™m at [Web 2.0 and Beyond &#8211; Applying Social and Collaborative Tools To Business][1] .

**Technology Brings Power to the People**

Crispin O&#8217;Brien KPMG

Recent survey published &#8211; Enterprise 2.0 The Benefits and Challenges of Adoptions

John Chambers CEO Cisco &#8211; Cisco moving into enterprise Web 2.0 because old space they compete in is becoming too crowded&#8230;

So what has all this stuff got to do with business? And what do you let through the firewall?

Internal benefits &#8211; find stuff, keep track of what we know, share who and what we know

External benefits &#8211; get really close to customers, harness ideas (LOTS of ideas), find and nurture partners / suppliers

The human dynamics of encouraging people to share and contribute &#8211; possibly tie in some part of reward to sharing behaviours?

Email and intranet is bilateral, sequential, run centrally and DULL

To find stuff we use Google &#8211; why not use those sort of tools in business

Corporate blogs &#8211; ideally uncensored&#8230;

Controlled collaboration &#8211; walled gardens

The power of tagging.

Innovation and sharing &#8211; successful companies of the future need to take heed of all their stakeholders.

There are risks of course, but need to update the controls and risk management.
