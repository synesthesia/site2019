[This][1] Read/Write Web [article][1] led me to [Iceberg][2], a product from Irish company [Fractis][3] which aims to make it possible for non-programmers to rapidly assemble business workflow applications.

The applicationn, now at version 2.1, is based on ASP.NET  and SQL Server, and is available as a free download. Licensing is free for non-profits or for up to 5 business users. A hosted version is available starting at $40/month for up to 5 users.

Users are encourage to upload their [applications][4] to the Iceberg site, either for free re-use or for sale.

The Read/Write web article points to their first look at the beta, in July 2007, and identifies similarities to and differences from [Coghead][5], [Salesforce AppExchange][6] and  [BungeeConnect][7]. Another alternative which I have come across previously is [PAT][8] from British company [Ninth Wave][8].

Over the next few days I’m going to try building a simple application using Iceberg and will post my findings here.
