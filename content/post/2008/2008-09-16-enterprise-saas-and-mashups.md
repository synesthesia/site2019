Bill Ives’ [Portals and KM][1] blog has been in my feedlist for a while. This morning I spotted that he has been very prolific recently (across several platforms) on the related subjects of Software as a Service (SaaS) and enterprise [mashups][2].

At [FASTForward][3], he reports on <cite><a href="https://www.fastforwardblog.com/2008/09/10/why-and-how-to-saas-â€“-jeff-kaplan-at-serena-tag/">Why and How to SaaS</a>, </cite>a view by Jeff Kaplan of [THINKStrategies][4], and links back to [an earlier conference presentation][5] by Pete Fields at [Wachovia][6] bank

At [The AppGap][7] Bill [writes][8] about the provision of of [Web 2.0 for talent management][8] by [SuccessFactors][9].

And at his own Portals and KM blog Bill has a series of (sponsored) posts from the [Serena][10] Tag 2008 conference, including the views of [Forrester][11] and [Gartner][12] on mashups in the enterprise.
