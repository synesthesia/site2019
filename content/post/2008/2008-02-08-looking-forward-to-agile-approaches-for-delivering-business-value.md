I’m planning to attend [Agile Approaches for Delivering Business Value][1] next week.

It looks like an interesting set of sessions, and although I doubt I’ll be liveblogging, I aim to post some notes here as soon afterwards as I can.

I’m particularly interested in two of the talks on the second day:

“A Square Peg in a Round Hole: Agile and fixed-price contracts” by [Duncan Pierce][2];

“When XP Met Outsourcing” by [Angela Martin][3].

In my current environment almost all our systems development is carried out by suppliers in various contractual models, and I’ve hit some frustrations in getting acceptance of Agile methods. I’m keen to learn how others may have constructed a “win-win” in this sort of situation.
