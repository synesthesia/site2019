As I touched on in [my last post][1], I am currently recuperating from an operation on a toe. The constraints I have are that I have to keep my foot elevated as much as possible, am confined to the house, and when I do stand or walk I have to wear a [special shoe][2] to keep me from applying any weight to the fore part of my foot and to protect the protuding [K-wire][3].

Having [worked hard][4] before the operation to get my CV system into reasonable shape, Iâ€™m frustrated at the feeling that my fitness is slipping back down again. As I feel physically well apart from my foot, I wanted to work out some exercise I could do in the house. A further constraint is that the only weights we have at home are from an old, small set, and the biggest single weight I can assemble is 12kg.

After some experimentation, including using a footstool as a poor substitute for a swiss ball, Iâ€™ve come up with the following mini-circuit:

  * single arm chest press (both sides)
  * single arm bent-over row (both sides)
  * sumo squat
  * single arm curl to single arm overhead press (both sides)

Where the weight I have available is less than I would normally use, I increase the workload by increasing reps and slowing down the cadence. It seems to work well enough to get my heart rate up, and so far as I can tell does not involve any movements which would be dangerous. Itâ€™s a long way from being the equivalent of a full workout in the gym, but I hope this will at least make gym re-entry less painful ðŸ™‚
