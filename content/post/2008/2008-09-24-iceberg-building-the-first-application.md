I’m [trying out Iceberg][1], the workflow automation platform.

Having successfuly [installed][2] the platform on my laptop I want to start building something. Of course, the two key questions before building any software (assuming the “Why?” in this case) are “What?” and “How?”.

For the “How?”, Iceberg provide a good overview on their [support][3] pages, which in essence boils down to:

  * Create the application
  * Create the business objects
  * Create relationships between objects
  * Create forms
  * Create views
  * Add behaviour and workflow
  * Security and permissions
  * Connectivity

For the “What?”, I’m going to build a Project Issue Tracker for use in a [Prince2][4] project environment. I shall start by creating some user stories, linked from [this wiki page][5].

I shall update this post later in the process.
  
<ins datetime="2008-09-24T11:43:54+00:00"><br /> Later&#8230; I now have the first two user stories added to the wiki, <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/wikka/IssueTrackerStory0001">Capture Project Issues</a> and <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/wikka/IssueTrackerStory0002">Examine Project Issues</a></ins>

In the next post I will document the first of these being added to Iceberg
