**Business in Virtual Worlds, How we got here with Web 2.0**

[Ian Hughes][2], Metaverse Evangelist IBM

  * What are metaverses and virtual worlds and why are they at a social media conf?
  * And why do IBM care?

It&#8217;s all about people&#8230; In virtual worlds the visible presence and (e.g.) body language provides strong social signals.

Fundamentally no different from blogs, IM etc &#8211; still about people and conversations

About user-created content &#8211; just like blogs / wikis / flickr

Real-life sensitivities &#8211; e.g. the tribute band [U2 in SL][3]&#8230; except that U2 and the record company seem to have worked out that this doesn&#8217;t hurt the U2 brand.

But online reputation counts&#8230; identity is important, but some protection in people recognising imposters through inconsistent behaviour.

Intraverses &#8211; virtual worlds inside the firewall

Virtual World Guidelines &#8211; treat it as a new country, learn and observe, connect and talk with fellow (insert company name), act with integrity, it&#8217;s the internet &#8211; beware and be broad-minded&#8230;

&#8220;Web 2.0 is Web Do&#8221;
