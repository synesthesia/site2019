Iâ€™m at [Web 2.0 and Beyond &#8211; Applying Social and Collaborative Tools To Business][1]

The Power of Film &#8211; Adding video podcasts to the communications mix

Joyce Lewis, [University of Southampton][2]

First video podcasting news service in any UK university (March 2006)

_&#8220;People don&#8217;t care about cold facts. They care about pictures or stories&#8221;_ &#8211; Nancy Green, Donovan and Green.

ECS website has 827,000 pages(!). Video podcasting backs up a lot of the messages .

Inclusion and empowerment &#8211; for example, use of videos to support staff through a major upheaval after a key building was destroyed, adding emotional depth.

JE thought &#8211; how is this &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;? &#8211; feels just like broadcasting to me&#8230;
