**KM Goes Social: From KM 1.0 to KM 2.0** 

[David Gurteen][2]

Impact of social tools on Knowledge Management &#8211; growth of &#8220;KM 2.0&#8221;

Techno-centric KM (tools) vs People-Centric KM (attitudes, soft tools)

KM in the doldrums &#8211; over-promised, under-delivered in business terms

Social tools are fundamentally about sharing knowledge &#8211; personal/social KM! (but not usually coming from the KM community or tool vendors)

Everything is 2.0 now &#8211; i.e. participatory. Can be seen as disruptive and subversive.

Combine people-centric KM and social tools to form KM 2.0

Managing tacit knowledge

KM as part of everyday work (thinking out loud) rather than extra work.
