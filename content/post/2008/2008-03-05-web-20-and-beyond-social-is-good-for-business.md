Neil Burton, [Web Spiders][2]

[Enterprise Snockles][3] &#8211; a corporate version of [Snockles][4] &#8211; yet another social messaging app which looks like another [Twitter.][5] 

Aimed at creating a corporate social network to build better commercial and team relationships, improve knowledge management, build communities, speed up innovation.
