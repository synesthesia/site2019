I&#8217;ve just heard that I have passed my PRINCE2 Practitioner qualification, thanks to the excellent help of [Pearce Mayfield][1].

I&#8217;ve been &#8220;broadly familiar&#8221; with the [PRINCE2][2] method for a number of years, but have resisted getting into it too deeply because of the bureaucratic nightmare I have seen many organisations make from it.

One of the best things I can say about the Pearce Mayfield training is that through it I have seen, by contrast,Â  how to make PRINCE2 a living and breathing approach to delivering a project.
