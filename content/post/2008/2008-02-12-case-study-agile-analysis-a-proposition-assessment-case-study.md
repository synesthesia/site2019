I’m blogging the conference [Agile Approaches for Delivering Business Value][1]

**Agile Analysis: A Proposition Assessment Case Study** 

_[Luke Barrett][2], Senior Business Analyst, [Thoughtworks][3]_

**Summary**

While the benefits of taking an Agile approach to the heart of the software development cycle are becoming increasingly recognised, this people-centric, communication-oriented, test-driven way of working is also powerful in helping teams and organisations early in the evolution of a idea or proposition.

In this case study we look at applying an Agile way of working to the analysis of a new business idea at its inception &#8211; this includes the creation and iteration of key deliverables (financial model, project roadmap, core processes and usage scenarios) to allow a go / no-go decision.

**Note**

What is role of business analyst in an agile organisation?

Agile values of simplicity, openness, communication, courage…

Apply agile software approach to evaluating business propositions.

Project – a new business idea which the owner wants to get funding for…

New business idea – challenge to validate within limited time and funds. e.g. what could be done in a week?

Objective – Prepare a Pitch, based on a clearer definition of the proposition, e.g.: financial model, key processes and goals, capacity model, customer scenarios, development roadmap for the business.

Small team – two consultants plus client.

1 week &#8211; each day based on two Action-Reflection cycles – 2 hr workshop, consolidate, 2 hr workshop, consolidation.

Keep it self-documenting

Models: traditionally use lots words of words to drive out ambiguity – but words are slippery! Important to facilitate a feedback-driven iteration towards consensus of the stakeholders. Use lots of visual models.

<ol class="decimal">
  <li>
    Started with finances – costs, revenues… A very quick ballpark analysis. Over the 5 days about 1.5 days on this.
  </li>
  <li>
    Processes, roles and goals – the core of what the business does. Imagine a “day in the life”.
  </li>
  <li>
    Capacity model – what resources needed to deliver the service?
  </li>
  <li>
    Service development roadmap – how does the business grow?
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer scenarios – what will it be like for a customer to use the service? Lots of Post-Its and pictures!
  </li>
</ol>

Put client in position to pitch to prospective investors and customers with supporting information, and brought to life with the scenarios.

The output had a positive reception!

Co-location of the team was vital – and if you aren’t, you can’t have a virtual beer together! (relationships vital).

Importance of dedicated time, dedicated effort / resources. “the heartbeat of feedback”
