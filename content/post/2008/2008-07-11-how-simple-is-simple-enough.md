Or **“Simplifying an ‘architecture framework’ for agile strategy”**

How often have you faced the situation where you need to get something done, and you know there’s all sorts of advice and guidance available, but you only have a limited time to implement something?

My current challenge is to relatively rapidly put together some strategic roadmaps for the systems in a business area.

In the past I’ve spent a very small amount of time studying [TOGAF][1], just enough to appreciate the coverage of the model and to feel overwhelmed by the amount of material and unfamiliar language.

My current feeling is that it <u>could</u> serve as a guide for the piece of work I need to do, but I need to find a lightweight way through it.

Apologies in advance to all the experts out there, but I think the gist of what it says is:

  * Agree the objectives of the piece of work
  * Review the business environment and understand the drivers for change
  * Sketch out some possible changes to the business environment (e.g. process changes)
  * Review the impact on the systems and data, and sketch out some possible changes.
  * Review the impact on the technology, and sketch out some possible changes.
  * Decide on some interventions on all three levels that will address the drivers for change
  * Do some of them
  * Review and repeat as necessary

Seems logical, I’ll see how it goes – and if this is something you specialise in let me know if I’m missing something!
