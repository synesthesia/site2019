I’m at [Web 2.0 and Beyond &#8211; Applying Social and Collaborative Tools To Business][1] .

**Who&#8217;s Afraid of Identity?**

Tom Ilube, [Garlik][2]

Garlik aiming at the &#8220;mainstream digital consumer&#8221;

Explosion of personal data on the web in last 18 months. Equivalent huge rise in ID theft.

Consumers don&#8217;t understand identity management&#8230;

But people make decisions about us based on our web status&#8230;

And then the talk ended &#8211; mostly a &#8220;here we are&#8221; pitch for Garlik without actually saying anything about what they do&#8230;
