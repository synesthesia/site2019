**Social Computing and the Knowledge-Powered Enterprise**

John Davies, [Next Generation Web Research Group, BT][2]

**Social computing & Web 2.0**

(user-generated, user-tagged content; social networking tools)

  * 3rd generation KM &#8211; emergent social networks, opt-in, self-organising, tools chosen and integrated by the community
  * social computing landscape &#8211; Ad-hoc-Structure, Personal-Enterprise. Link technologies to objectives.
  * Knowledge-powered Enterprise &#8211; most knoweldge worker activity not based on formal processes &#8211; in people&#8217;s heads or unstructured documents. Most knowledge workers need to draw on knowledge from colleagues and from outside the enterprise.

**Case studies**

  * BT: &#8220;[Hubbub][3]&#8221; Web 2.0 customer community as support and self-service channel. Business case: call deflection and improved service. 20% of user base for covered products have used the system.
  * IBM: &#8220;[Dogear][4]&#8221; &#8211; social bookmarking for the enterprise. Expertise location, improved quality of recommendations. Enhances results from enterprise search, use bookmarking as a quality indicator. Using individucal&#8217;s bookmarks to derive user profiles, team bookmarks as project resources. Integrated into Lotus Connections.

**Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web (web 3.0)**

  * Extending the web to use computers to do more linking of meaning.
  * Ontologies provide a formal description of an information domain &#8211; a taxonomy is a simple example of an ontology.
  * &#8220;Scruffies&#8221; and &#8220;Neats&#8221; &#8211; bottom-up folksonomies vs. top-down ontologies. Not mutually exclusive
  * SemanticWiki &#8211; currently only keyword search, no consistency checking. Experiment &#8211; extend Wikipedia by adding type tags to links.
  * Project [ACTIVE][5]
