**Social Media in Action** 

[Adrian Moss][2] &#8211; BOTTLE PR and Focus Business Communications

**Poundland Case Study &#8211; using social media to support a retail operation.**

Number 1 single price discount retailer in Europe. IT driven retail distribution. Lots of short-run and end-of-line product.

Blog experiment to promote Xmas lines &#8211; aiming for <£1 cost per visitor

12k visitors in 10 weeks. <50p CPV. Lots of links from blog to company website. 100 active subscribers / Facebook friends. Typically each Facebook friend has 50-100 other friends. Echo chamber effect &#8211; 360% increase in referrals to website. [Blog][3] probably worth £0.5M already. Extrapolate to a full year, turnover ~ £1.5M <=> 0.5 of a store.

Key was planning. Audience, tone/style/format. Core objectives: engage with key targets, regular posts (3-7/wk), note new product lines.

Lessons: listen to feedback, adjust and adapt go with the flow and the rules, if you make a mistake, acknowledge
