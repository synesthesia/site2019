I&#8217;ve been experimenting again&#8230; and have moved the [Wiki][1] over to the [TikiWiki][2] package. On the basis of a few days experimentation this package looks incredibly powerful.

If you have links to the old Wiki please update them. if any .htaccess gurus out there want to advise me on how to set up automatic redirects then all advice welcome! ðŸ™‚

<ins>I&#8217;ve added a basic directory-level redirect &#8211; if anyone finds examples of links that still go to the wrong place please let me know!</ins>
