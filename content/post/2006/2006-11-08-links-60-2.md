  * [BPM and SOA: A Strategic Alliance][3]:
  
    SOA can exist without BPM, and BPM has flourished without a firm understanding of SOA. The combination of SOA and BPM is more powerful than either is alone. SOA provides the ability to create process independence. SOA, loosely coupled with BPM, automatically creates services that can be reused in many ways across an, enterprise, and in multiple processes that can be continuously improved.
  
    Keywords: [SOA][4], [BPM][5]
