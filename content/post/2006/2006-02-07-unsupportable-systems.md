In [Unsupportable Systems][1] [John Dale][2] identifies three key themes that lead into a downward spiral of system decay in terms of lower reliability and performance:

  * Increased volumes &#8211; leading to under-management or tactical attempts to increase capacity (which in turn often leads to the next factor);
  * Increased complexity &#8211; system additions that may or may not fit in with the original architecture;
  * Knowledge loss &#8211; in particular knowledge about how a system works that decays over time.

I think he&#8217;s right, for systems on almost any scale, from single-user to enterprise software, and I also think the issues are more deep-seated than John suggests. I&#8217;ve seen a few of the scenarios that John describes, and I reckon that they often arise as a result of systemic (and usually commercially-driven) pressures within the organisation that requires a new system.
