Via [Earl Mardle][1] I&#8217;ve found a new tool to add to my [personal knowledge management][2] toolkit: [Awasu][3]

Although the core of the product is an aggregator, it&#8217;s a lot more than that as it offers a number of ways of inter-acting with the flow of information through the tool, both manually and in various automated ways. It also offers the facility to add &#8220;[channel hooks][4]&#8221; &#8211; plugins which carry out specific actions on selected channels.

Having installed the product, I must admit the first learning hurdle was to get used to a thick-client aggregator rather than my [normal approach with Bloglines][5].

The next challenge was finding an easy way to blog using the tool. Although [Earl][1] recommends a workflow using [Qumana][6], I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the right one for me. I think that reticence is a little about Qumana: I&#8217;ve tried the tool before, in its earlier days and didn&#8217;t stick with it, so maybe I am transferring that to the latest version. Also, Earl&#8217;s proposed method involves using the [Workpads][7] and [Reports][8] in Awasu &#8211; functionality that I have played with, but not yet got to grips with fully. There have been a couple of funnies which might be bugs or might be configuration problems. 

I shall keep experimenting with different methods of using the tool and integrating it into my work, and may well come back to the approach earl suggests. In the interim I have taken advantage of the easily-configurable [User Tools][9] menu in Awasu to call up the normal WordPress posting page for this blog within the Awasu main window, pre-populated with key content from the source page.
