Update 1: <ins datetime="2008-05-18T10:38:20+00:00">As Nick Spargo points out in the comments these links are now dead. If anyone can point to the modern equivalent, that would be appreciated.</ins>

Update 2: <ins datetime="2009-11-27T08:47:48+00:00">Matthew Davis points to <a href="https://www.aof.mod.uk/">https://www.aof.mod.uk/</a>, but the specific link he posts is now dead.</ins>

    Matthew Davis said (05/05/2009) &#8220;I think that you will find that the ams website has been superceded by the acquisiton operating framework and that it will be some time before the benefits work is republished as per this link:<a style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; background-image: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: transparent; color: #21759b; word-wrap: break-word; text-decoration: none; background-position: initial initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.aof.mod.uk/aofcontent/tactical/ppm/content/whathappen_ppm.htm?zoom_highlight=benefits">https://www.aof.mod.uk/aofcontent/tactical/ppm/content/whathappen_ppm.htm?zoom_highlight=benefits</a>&#8220;
