This place has been looking rather dormant &#8211; and I realised that I was sinking into a negative loop &#8211; the longer I didn&#8217;t write here, the harder it seemed to start. So consider this a metaphorical &#8220;get in there and _do_ something&#8221;&#8230;

It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve not been busy &#8211; but a lot of that has been the sort of things I don&#8217;t write here (details of work stuff, and family life etc.) &#8211; and the things of which I might write have seemed so absorbing at the time that writing has not been on the agenda.

One thing that has been taking up a bit of time is a programming project to provide a web remote control to ITunes &#8211; [bliki]WebTunes[/bliki]. Unfortunately not much further than a proof of concept (spare time programming with something as complex as .Net is far from efficient!), but I might post some code if anyone is interested.

The other thing that has led to a few late nights is &#8220;looking for dead people&#8221; as someone described it &#8211; a resurgent interest in some family history research. I&#8217;ve fairly reliably traced my paternal line (Elve) back to the early 1800&#8217;s, and one of my mother&#8217;s ancestors ( Micklewright) back to about 1820. There are significantly more sources online than when I last looked at this about five years ago, but again I&#8217;m coming to the point where I can see a need to track down some primary sources &#8211; and that was where I lost steam before!

A few online resources that I have found useful in different ways: [ancestry.com][1], [Genes Reunited][2] and [FamilySearch.org][3].

I shall stop now whilst I&#8217;m ahead.
