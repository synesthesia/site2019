[This site][1] is an interesting adjunct to my [previous note][2] on geneaology &#8211; the [surname profiler][1] from UCL lets you compare the geographical distribution of a given surname in the UK between 1881 and 1998.

I did a quick test using my surname (Elve &#8211; or as it was commonly spelled in 1881, Elvey). The [1881 result][3] looks familiar from the 1881 census research I have been doing as part of finding my ancestors:

The [1998 map][5] is less useful &#8211; even though the spelling I use (Elve) is reasonably well-established, there is no mention of it in the database. So for 1998 I again searched on the &#8220;Elvey&#8221; spelling.

Nevertheless an interesting site.
