Having surfaced after summer holidays, a trade show visit and various bits of work, I&#8217;ve realised that the new October dates for the [MSP course][1] are only three weeks away &#8211; so time to get back into the pre-work!

With only a couple of loose pages of notes so far, it already looked like I was well on the way to a paper meltdown, so I&#8217;ve taken the time to dissect the pre-course exercise book and stick the pages into alternate pages of a wire-bound notebook &#8211; thus leaving plenty of white space for my answers and notes about related material.

This might sound very basic, but for me the physical act of putting together a study log has already started to make it feel as if I have the material &#8220;at my fingertips&#8221; (the power of metaphor!)
