Via [Brad Appleton][1]&#8216;s excellent post of links to [Agile Programme Management][2] resources, a paper on [Combining Agile Methods with Stage-Gate Project Management.][3]

Based on studies in three engineering companies, the conclusion is that are benefits from both the management and engineering perspective.

**Good things:**

  * Agile method add microplanning and day-to-day control to the stage-gate methods
  * Engineering teams felt more in control of their work
  * Stage-gate approach improves ability of agile methods to interact with other engineering teams, other functions (such as marketing) and senior management.

**Things to watch out for:**

  * Need to manage expectations
  * Challenge on large projects of finding a &#8220;customer representative&#8221; as required by Agile methods
