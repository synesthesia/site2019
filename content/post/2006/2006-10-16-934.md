I spent last week on the [Managing Successful Programmes course][1].

The trainers were good, the group size was good (9 of us), and the other delegates were an interesting and friendly bunch from a range of industries. Between us we covered print, broadcast and online media, telecomms, manufacturing, software, and a couple of flavours of consultancy.

I&#8217;d recommend this course to anyone who was interested in [MSP][2] &#8211; the training is well-adapted for adult learning, and has a clear emphasis on providing the skills to get through the exams. It is however an intensive week &#8211; in particular on the first three evenings there was two to three hours of homework each night. The homework is framed as &#8220;optional&#8221;, but as a large part of it is practice in answering exam questions, I would imagine that it would be hard to get through the exams without doing the homework.

I managed to pass the Foundation exam without much difficulty, but I won’t know the result of the Intermediate and Practitioner papers for about 8 weeks – apparently the [APMG][3] examiners are over-worked at present!

The material is still very &#8220;close to me&#8221; in my mind, so too early to reflect properly on what I have learned.
