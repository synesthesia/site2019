Innovative wiki company [Socialtext][1] have launched [group-based pricing][2] for their hosted wiki solutions, including unlimited free wikis for groups of 5 or less. As CEO [Ross Mayfield says][3], this is
  
<q cite="https://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/03/groupbased_pric.html">&#8230;reflecting how the unit of value in wikis is the group that uses it&#8230;</q>.

I&#8217;m a big fan of Socialtext, with the help of their hosted solution I was able to get a small project group introduced to the wiki way long before we had in-house wiki facilities, and I always found them very helpful. This is a great approach to pricing that lets the power of wikis spread in the best way possible &#8211; word of mouth in small groups.

Good luck Ross!
