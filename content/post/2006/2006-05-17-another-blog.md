One of the reasons I&#8217;ve been quiet in this blog has been that I have started another [blog][1] specifically focused on [Managing Successful Programmes][1].

When I set that blog up, I was planning on attending a training course in June on [Managing Successful Programmes][2] (MSP), leading (hopefully) to the [practitioner certificatation][3]. [MSP][4] is the UK [Office of Government Commerce][5] (OGC) approach to ensuring the success of [major change programmes.][6]

I&#8217;ve set up the [other site][1] as an online learning diary, and a central place for various notes. To support the blog there is also a [wiki][7] for more long-form notes.
  
Unfortunately the [course][8] I was attending has been withdrawn for June by the provider. Looks like I shall now go in October. Inevitably my motivation to go through the pre-work has been somewhat reduced, however I shall continue to post over there &#8211; I&#8217;m finding lots of ways to introduce key elements of the [MSP approach][9] into day-to-day work.

This should also mean that I have a little more online time to keep this place up-to-date!
