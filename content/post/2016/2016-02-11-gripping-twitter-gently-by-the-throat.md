In <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/2016/02/11/breaking-the-ubiquity-of-stream-mode/" target="_blank">Breaking the Ubiquity of Stream&nbsp;Mode</a> I wrote that, inspired by <a href="http://www.elsua.net/2015/09/23/is-twitter-where-connections-go-to-die-the-unfollowing-experiment/" target="_blank">&#8220;Is Twitter Where Connections Go to Die? â€“ The Unfollowing Experiment&#8221;</a>, &nbsp;I would start taking overt control of my Twitter use.

I shall use this post to both plan and report progress

**Updated 12 Feb 2016**

First part is to decide on the lists I want. I can&#8217;t disagree with the initial triumvirate described by Luis &#8211; &nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.elsua.net/2015/09/24/collaborators-cooperators-and-people-i-learn-from/" target="_blank">Collaborators, Cooperators and People I Learn From</a>&#8221;

I also think I need a couple more public lists that reflect my other uses of Twitter &#8211; probably one for local / London accounts.

I also think I need some private lists &#8211; certainly for friends/family.

And during the migration process I will probably put up a temporary public list for &#8220;People I used to follow&#8221; &#8211; this will be a good place to link to this post to explain what is happening.

Moving people to lists and unfollowing through a normal Twitter client is SLOW &#8211; I estimated about 6 weeks work.

There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a tool that will do it all in one go, so I have split the task:

  for updating list membership <a href="http://twitlistmanager.com/">TwitListManager</a>&nbsp;seems to do the trick, with a simple tabular display:

    From a couple of comments it&#8217;s clear that some people didn&#8217;t get beyond the title of the list &#8220;People I used to follow&#8221;, so I&#8217;ve renamed it to the (perhaps) clearer &#8220;Moving from follow to lists&#8221;.

    Interesting as well to see the people for whom Twitter is only about the follower count. I&#8217;ve even been accused of being &#8220;passive aggressive&#8221; by a follower of one of the people I unfollowed ðŸ™‚ &nbsp;I suppose I shouoldn&#8217;t be surprised that a change which is designed to emphasise Twitter as conversation will seem odd to those who think of it as a broadcast channel.
