A <a href="http://www.elsua.net/2015/10/20/10th-year-blogiversary-the-unfinished-journey-of-blogging-and-why-it-matters/" target="_blank">blog post</a> by [Luis Suarez][1]¬†has served nicely as a catalyst to start crystallizing some thoughts from the last couple of weeks.

### Discomfort

I&#8217;ve become increasingly aware of¬†tensions I feel when I think about how I manage my [personal sense-making][2]. In hindsight the seeds were sown when taking Harold Jarche&#8217;s [PKM¬†in 40 days][3] course. During that study [I realised that although I &#8220;talk the talk&#8221; around PKM, mostly what I do is the &#8220;Seek&#8221;][4] part of [Seek-Sense-Share][5], with sharing only at the level of filtering a set of [public bookmarks][6]. My approach to sense-making is opportunistic, driven by the needs of the moment, and often quite ephemeral¬†&#8211; knowledge is cast away to the depths of memory when not needed for the task in hand.

I&#8217;ve noticed a number of things, which I now suspect are related:

  * I become more and more convinced that [email is toxic][7], yet find myself dragged back into using it by the unhealthy habits of those I work with. Although I find the collaboration in [Luis&#8217;s #no-email Slack group][8] to be a great support, I spent much of last year not participating
  * I&#8217;m increasingly aware of tensions whenever I think about long-form writing and thinking &#8211; a whole blog post feels like a lot of pressure! üôÇ
  
    _As an aside, I wonder if in fact my long-form thinking is being expressed in a different medium &#8211; code &#8211; although the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianelve" target="_blank">job title</a> might mislead you, I write quite a bit of code these days ¬†&#8211; and &#8220;[code is poetry][9]&#8221; after all!_
  * I find myself attracted to <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/2016/02/02/federated-wiki/" target="_blank">Federated Wiki</a> &#8211; the combined timelessness of wiki ( = &#8220;no pressure&#8221;) with it being &#8220;my site&#8221;. The ability to quickly bang together related thoughts on pages which are never &#8220;finished&#8221; feels more accessible¬†than the blank page, dated post, tyranny of the blog
  * I like the speed of <a href="http://fargo.io/" target="_blank">Fargo</a> (although the default blog style with dates is a bit reminiscent of timelines). Publishing via <a href="http://synesthesiaworknotes.smallpict.com/" target="_blank">smallpict.com</a> is baked in, if I plan to use this tool more I want my own server, and not just <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/worknotes/" target="_blank">syndicate</a> it.
  * Regardless of anything I say in this post, I&#8217;m still quite attracted by the immediacy of a Twitter timeline, the frequent updates on Facebook, the serendipitous comments that arise when I post the name of the film I am about to watch &#8211; I&#8217;ve realised that acknowledging that attraction is a key step in starting to build something else into my practice

### Analysis

Part of recognising an issue is to be aware of the feelings of discomfort, and part is having the¬†right concepts to categorise what is happening.

I came across [Mike Caulfield][10]&#8216;s multifarious¬†online presences when I started looking into Federated Wiki. The ones that have seemed most useful in this context are where he has drawn out the definition of [StreamMode][11], contrasted with [StateMode][12]¬† ([blog][13],¬†[highlighted version][14]). In his words,

> &#8220;You know that you are in StreamMode if you never return to edit the things you are posting on the web&#8221;
  
> (<a href="https://diigo.com/08cquk" target="_blank">context</a>, <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/10/14/what-iterative-writing-looks-like-and-why-its-important/" target="_blank">src</a>)

Mike recognises that StreamMode may have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> advantages, and <a href="http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/BillSeitz" target="_blank">Bill Seitz</a>¬†makes <a href="http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/StreamMode" target="_blank">an interesting contrast link</a>¬†to <a href="http://timkastelle.org/theblog/" target="_blank">Tim Kastelle</a>¬†¬†on <a href="http://timkastelle.org/blog/2010/06/manage-knowledge-flow-not-knowledge-stocks-for-innovation-success/" target="_blank">Managing Knowledge Flow, not Knowledge Stocks</a>

But&#8230;.

Or in the words of Jack Dorsey &#8211; &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/696081671293001728" target="_blank">Twitter is live, Twitter is real-time</a>&#8221; &#8211; both its strength and its weakness.

**The Firehose is addictive &#8211; it makes us feel ‚Äúin touch with the pulse‚Äù at the same time as it weakens our ability to pause and take stock &#8211; it is the refined white sugar of the knowledge world.**

### What&#8217;s Next

Change relies on motivation and a plan.

So you have an addiction &#8211; do you really want to fix it?

Why would I want to reduce the hold that StreamMode has over my online interactions?

Put very simply, if I&#8217;m going to spend time online, I want it to be useful in some way &#8211; personally, professionally.

And the plan? Reinforce positive behaviours, and manage those which are inefficient, unhelpful or not-fun.

Although I complained above about being dragged back into the toxicity of email I have had some success with &#8220;<a href="http://johnstepper.com/2014/01/04/the-5-elements-of-working-out-loud/" target="_blank">Working Out Loud</a>&#8220;:

  * Using a <a href="http://www.aha.io/" target="_blank">product management toolset</a> that within the scope of a single user licence allows me to make my planning work visible across the company, and for colleagues to comment, and create their own <a href="http://www.aha.io/product/features/ideas" target="_blank">ideas</a> for change (_sorry for the plug, but I really like the tool_)
  * With internal and external technical teams, reinforcing the use of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">DVCS repositories</a>, and using comments and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/work-with-pull-requests-223220593.html" target="_blank">pull requests</a> as a way of documenting our design discussions
  * Wherever I can, moving more general internal discussions to a combination of <a href="https://www.yammer.com" target="_blank">Yammer</a> and <a href="https://products.office.com/en-GB/sharepoint?legRedir=true&CorrelationId=effcfe6c-23dc-4bb4-8e9d-1b5929c32adb" target="_blank">internal blogs</a>

So a big part of my strategy is to keep using these, and move more and more of my &#8220;inside the firewall&#8221; conversations to them.

Outside the firewall, in many ways I feel I have been going backwards, not least because outside the firewall is where the stream is so pervasive.

I think the first step is to take¬†back some control, and of all the things I have read, Luis&#8217;s approach to <a href="http://www.elsua.net/2015/09/23/is-twitter-where-connections-go-to-die-the-unfollowing-experiment" target="_blank">gripping Twitter by the throat and bending it to his will</a> is the most appealing.

So I&#8217;m <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/2016/02/11/gripping-twitter-gently-by-the-throat/" target="_blank">planning my own version of the &#8220;<strong><em>Great Unfollowing</em></strong>&#8220;</a>

That will do for a start. There will be more on evolving practices, but another secret to making a change is not to try too many things at once.

And change often needs a public commitment &#8211; here it is!
