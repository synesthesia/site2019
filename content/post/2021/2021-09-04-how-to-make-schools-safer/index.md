One of the most compelling commentators I have been following throughout the pandemic is [Prof. Christina Pagel (@chrischirp)](https://twitter.com/chrischirp), Director of the [Clinical Operational Research Unit at UCL](http://t.co/5Os9k9vGTS) and a member of [Independent SAGE](https://www.independentsage.org/).

In a recent [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/chrischirp/status/1434211010529923072) she flags that:

* last November, cases in school children were high and rising
  
* Independent Sage released a [plan for safer schools](https://www.independentsage.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Safe-schools-v4b1.pdf), and a detailed safer workplaces charter

* Key principles they advised for schools in Novemeber 2020 were:
  
  * Distancing (implying smaller classes and reorganisation)
  * Ventilation
  * Face coverings
  * Bubbles (consistent self-contained groups)
  * Self-isolation: In the case of infections, the bubble should form the basis for isolating contacts.
  * Testing (all staff and students within a bubble should be tested where they are positive cases)
  * Learning resources to support home-based learning with books as well as IT
  * Examinations - schools need to focus on learning and wellbeing, without sources of stress - replace secondary school exams replaced with assessment by teachers, with suitable moderation
  * Wellbeing - creative thinking to ensure that young people are able to socialise safely
  * Transparency - clear information should be provided to all stakeholders and organisations
  * Advice and support from local public health teams
  * Staff welfare and morale

* Pagel notes that a year later little of their advice has been picked up and implemented by central government, and cases in school children are even higher than they were last year

* Independent Sage have [relaunched an updated safer workplaces charter](https://www.independentsage.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Workplace-charter-2021-redux.pdf)

* They have issued a consultation document on [Covid Safety Codes of Practice](https://www.independentsage.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Covid-codes-final-1-1.pdf)
