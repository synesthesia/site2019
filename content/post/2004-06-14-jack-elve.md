Today would have been my father&#8217;s 87th birthday. For some reason it seems more important to remember him on this day than on the anniversary of his death &#8211; perhaps because the things I remember about him are about life, in particular the things I learnt without knowing &#8211; that only now I am learning to recognise in me too.
