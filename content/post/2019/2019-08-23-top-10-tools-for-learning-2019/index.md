Every year Jane Hart runs a [survey of learning tools](http://modernworkplacelearning.com/magazine/janes-top-ten-2019/)   

Here's my entry for 2019:

## Drafts

Incredibly versatile tool for creating and re-purposing text on iOS devices. Custom actions written in JavaScript allow me to push, pull and manipulate text pretty much as I need. A core part of my personal / professional learning. This post created in Drafts.

## Hugo

Earlier this year I [migrated my blog from WordPress to Hugo](https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/project/wp-to-hugo/) and I'm extremely happy with the result. Malware -resistant, and if you are prepared to learn Markdown, a much faster way of capturing thoughts.

## Fedwiki

I got my teeth back into [Federated Wiki](https://wiki.synesthesia.co.uk/view/welcome-visitors) this year, and it's a great tool for building out concepts as part of note-taking or reflection


## Feedly

Feedly is my key tool for keeping up to date across a range of personal and professional interests.

## Diigo

Probably the single tool I use the most - pretty much any page I find interesting or have to look at for work gets bookmarked into Diigo. The highlighting and annotation tools are usually the first step in sense-making.

##  IFTTT 

If This Then That provides the essential glue to connect tools together and make the information flow through my learning process

##  Microsoft Teams

Rapidly becoming the focal point of my work collaboration. Replacing Skype for business, but also as an integration point that allows an ad-hoc group to see all the information they use on their joint work in a single place

## Twitter

Usually my first source for information from selected parts of my network. Use of lists is essential to filter the firehouse.

##  OneNote

Still has a place for work note-taking that sits within our Offoce365 environment.

## Github

For the parts of my personal and professional learning that relate to code, Github is key. Whether it's reading other people's code, sharing my own ideas or collaborating on open source this tool is essential.
