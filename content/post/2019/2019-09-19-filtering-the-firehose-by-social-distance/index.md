I was delighted to be tweeted by Ton Zylstra, an old blogging contact from the Triassic era of blogs...
{{< tweet 1173571836770172928 >}}

Thanks to Ton's little prompt I realise I remember [Blogwalk IV]({{< relref "/post/2004/2004-09-18-blogwalk-iv.md" >}}), and reading back over the posts here and elsewhere I'm struck by how much is still relevant 15 years later - but that's for another post (as is an update on IndieWeb).

Inevitably following links to revisit [Ton's blog](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/) I found [Feed reading by Social Distance](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/feed-reading-by-social-distance/)

So would I try this experiment myself?

Looking back at the earlier Twitter-based idea, I backtracked fairly quickly. Although I still have the
