Some evenings our route home takes us past a house in North London that always has a good show of lights at this time of year.

This year they have surpassed themselves with a scrolling seasonal greeting:

Some will look down their noses at such an overt display - it's a long way from the subdued decorations in neighbourhoods such as Mayfair, Beacon Hill or the Upper East Side - but I find these things always give a small boost of positive feeling on a dark and wet evening!

I tried a quick google search for studies that looked at this positive affect, but mostly the search results are newspaper articles of the "experts say..." style - the only studies I could find mostly related to the impact of lighting choices on the workplace.

Any pointers?
