As I am doing a fair bit of content pruning and editing as part of the transfer from [WordPress to Hugo]({{< ref "/project/wp-to-hugo" >}}) I'll keep this post updated with what has changed:

* tagging done back to 2014, plus a few earlier posts
* have deleted all the auto-generated linklog posts which came from del.icio.us
* have added a link to [my public shared bookmarks on Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/profile/synesthesia) to my about page
