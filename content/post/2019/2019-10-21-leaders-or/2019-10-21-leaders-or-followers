With the merest hint of irony [Andrew Jacobs suggests](https://lostanddesperate.com/2019/10/14/developing-leadership-capability/) that what many organisations really want are not better leaders, but better followers:

> - Developing trust with insincere people
> - Learning to believe anything/everything someone says
> - Being inspired by uninspirational people
> - Being passionate in an uncommitted environment
> - Understanding mixed messages
> - Working with indecisive people
> - Taking blame with confidence
> - Appreciating the learning points of the excessive workload
> - Giving up ideas for the credit of others
> - Working without praise
> - Being manipulated with appreciation

The recent years of UK politics would suggest that there are many faces we see on our screens every day who want the same :-)
