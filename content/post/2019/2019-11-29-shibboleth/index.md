Richard Murphy thinks that [Boris Johnson has created a shibboleth: no one with any self respect could vote for him](https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2019/11/29/boris-johnson-has-created-a-shibboleth-no-one-with-any-self-respect-could-vote-for-him/)

> Johnsonâ€™s behaviour is alien. His refusal to play this election by the normal rules of decency, fair play, mutual self-respect and integrity confirm that Johnson really is a man willing to cheat, lie and sabotage his way to power at any cost. We have not seen a politician so brazen before. I hope we do not again.
