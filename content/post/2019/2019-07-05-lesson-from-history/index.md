Several commentators, dismayed at the recent antics of the Brexit party MEPs, have been tweeting variants of a quote from Josef Goebbels in the Nazi paper [_Der Angriff_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Angriff)  [^1] :

>We enter the Reichstag to arm ourselves with democracy’s weapons. If democracy is foolish enough to give us free railway passes and salaries, that is its problem. It does not concern us. Any way of bringing about the revolution is fine by us.
If we succeed in getting sixty or seventy of our party’s agitators and organizers elected to the various parliaments, the state itself will pay for our fighting organization. That is amusing and entertaining enough to be worth trying
>

Among the tweeters, Otto English, who used the quote in his [article](https://bylinetimes.com/2019/07/03/defeating-democracy-with-its-own-weapons-a-warning-from-history/) for Byline Times [^2]:

{{< tweet id="1146408406829412352" user="Otto_English" >}}

and the academic, diplomat and author Dr Jennifer Cassidy:

{{< tweet id="1146112460828631040" user="OxfordDiplomat" >}}

Is this justified alarm, or is it another example of [Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law)? [^3] _("As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1")_

My gut feel is that this is just another piece in the bizarre take over of British politics by the populist right since 2016 - each event on it's own seems almost laughable, but when they are taken together it becomes something entirely different. 

We need our historians now...
