In [Forget knowledge sharing, lets encourage knowledge seeking instead](http://www.nickmilton.com/2020/01/forget-knowledge-sharing-lets-encourage.html), [Nick Milton](http://www.nickmilton.com/) says 
>don't bother [incentivising knowledge sharing]. Incentivise knowledge seeking and re-use instead..."

Which he justifies by saying:

>knowledge sharing in itself achieves nothing. Knowledge needs to be sought and re-used before any value has been added, and re-use is often a far bigger barrier than knowledge sharing. The Not Invented Here syndrome is far more prevalent than Knowledge Hoarding.

In other posts he has talked about the market for knowledge within an organisation, and the importance of [balancing supply and demand](http://www.nickmilton.com/2016/06/balancing-knowledge-supply-and-demand.html). He suggests that the [two key questions](http://www.nickmilton.com/search?q=two+questions) that managers should ask are "Who did you learn from?" and "Who have you shared with?", with an emphasis on the former.

Going to try a little experiment...
