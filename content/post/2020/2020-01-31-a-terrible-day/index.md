Last day for UK in the EU.

A terrible act of national self-harm.

The loss of rights for millions.

A deeply divided society.

As much as I admire Keir Starmer insisting that [another future is possible](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/labour-leave-remain-divide-brexit),  today my sentiments are far better expressed by [Professor Chris Grey](https://chrisgreybrexitblog.blogspot.com/).

In the long piece [A day to mourn](https://chrisgreybrexitblog.blogspot.com/2020/01/a-day-to-mourn.html) he closes this way:

> So I mourn the country we have already lost, and fear for the one to come. For, dark as today is for so many of us, there may well be far darker days ahead.
