Just finished watching the 3-part BBC documentary "[Stewart Copeland's Adventures in Music](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000db8k)".

Copeland's enthusiasm for the subject is engaging but ultimately I found the series frustrating, because it erred too much on the descriptive - e.g. "Music can introduce a transcendental state" and too light on the explanatory - the interviews with neuroscientists and psychologists were almost reduced to sound bites.

However one of those scientists is [Daniel Levitin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Levitin), and I'm now reading his recent book [This is Your Brain on Music](https://amzn.to/36PFicz), which I hope  is going to address some of those questions.
