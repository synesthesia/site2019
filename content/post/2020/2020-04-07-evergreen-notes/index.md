I was led to [Andy Matuschack](https://andymatuschak.org/)'s idea of [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes):

> Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects
> *  Evergreen notes should be atomic
> * Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
> * Evergreen notes should be densely linked
> * Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies

As I tweeted in reply, a lot about that reminds me of the [natural writing style of Federated Wiki](https://pkm.wiki.synesthesia.co.uk/view/welcome-visitors/view/a-fedwiki-style-sheet), and when you look at [Andy's site](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) in a desktop browser and start clicking links, [concepts open up to the side](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes?stackedNotes=z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1) in a way reminiscent of the FedWiki approach.

Another nice feature is the popout summary of another note when you mouseover a link. Notable is the lack of mention of federation, or any concept of multi-user use, however as Andy [states](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) "it's still an early research environment"

More interesting than the tool is the note-taking approach and it's sources. Andy cites a major influence as [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann)'s [Zettelkasten](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Zettelkasten) approach. 

[Christian Tietze](https://twitter.com/ctietze) maintains [The Zettlekasten Project](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) which contains some interesting material to mine later. Clearly there are links here to [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush)'s work in [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) but again, something to mine later.
