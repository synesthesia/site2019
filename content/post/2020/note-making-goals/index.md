## Why do I make notes?

One of those questions that seems ridiculously simple on first look, but which pull out more depth as you sit on it for a while.

### Recording and planning action

* What did I do?
* What have I got to do tomorrow / next month / next quarter?
* What is the plan for any of those future things?

### Recording knowledge

* what do I need to remember in order to do this task or project?
* what did I find out?
* who else has something useful to say on this topic?
* what questions are unanswered?

### Developing thought

* what are the possible courses of action?
* what do I think I _should_ do?
* what are the implications of what I have discovered?

## What do I want to improve

When I considered my own note-making practice I observed that it was mostly short-term, and mostly task-focused. In other words keep just enough records to remember key conversations and decisions, and record just enough knowledge to **satisfice** for the task in hand. Often those task-focused notes are nothing more than a series of links to relevant online resources.

In terms of longer-term notes, although I have access to plenty of tools, I found I wasn't using them very much. In particular I noticed that for much of my professional activity I was relying on tacit knowledge, and that my use of explicit tools was somewhat constrained to my "hobby" activities.

In part that seems to be about how I manage the perennial balancing act of what I can discuss in public and what is proprietary to my employer. That barrier was in turn reflected in a disconnect of tooling - the more usable tools were the ones I have associated with my public discourse (such as this!).

I had no over-arching model of practice for my note-making practices which might serve as a scaffolding for improvement.

## Goals for the process

* Develop a frame of practice that can guide my note-making.
* Integrate note-making for knowledge management and note-making for work planning into  a single approach
* Harmonise my practices across personal and professional spheres to reduce friction, whilst maintaining appropriate separation of public and confidential notes.
* Simplify (or at least harmonise) the tool-sets I use
