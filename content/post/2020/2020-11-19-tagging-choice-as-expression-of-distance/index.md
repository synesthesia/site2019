How does our choice of words in a [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) demonstrate our world view?

In [New Emergent Tagging Practice](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/10/new-emergent-tagging-practice/), [Ton Zjilstra](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/about-me/) writes:

> The way I look at other peopleâ€™s tags is how their use of different words than mine for the same things is an expression of socio-professional distance. Others likely will be using their own jargon for things, and the more different that is, the more likely you are part of a different community than the circles I operate in. This lets me [use tags as a pivot to find other people](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2006/07/social_software/) and communities of interest and connected to my own current interest

Ton goes on to note that "the other" might be his own past or future self:

> With the new tagging practice, adding tags to a note over time based on how/why I found that note will allow me to see how my own language evolves. This leads I think to a similar measure of socio-professional distance, but now between my past, current and future selves


## Questions

* what research is there into how choice of language is sensitive to context, education and experience (rabbit hole!)
* are there any studies that show how use of language changes over a lifetime?
