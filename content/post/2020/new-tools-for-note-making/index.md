This post is part of my wider [enquiry into my note-making practices]({{< relref  "/project/note-making-practice/index.md" >}}).

The key technical requirements for my new note-taking setup are as follows:

* must be based on Markdown text files
* optionally the ability to enhance publishing with mdx
* able to seperate publishable files from private
* must support any backup or versioning that will for text fils (e.g. dropbox, GitHub)
* piblishing to static websit
