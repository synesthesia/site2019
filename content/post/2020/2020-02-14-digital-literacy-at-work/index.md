Google the term “digital literacy and the workplace” and you will be overwhelmed with the results. A good place to start might be the Adobe blog article [How Digital Literacy Affects the Modern Workforce](https://theblog.adobe.com/how-digital-literacy-affects-the-modern-workforce/).

A [tweet](https://twitter.com/ActivateLearn/status/1226950011822362624?s=20) by Helen Blunden pointed me at the work of [Tracy Van Der Schyff](https://tracyvanderschyff.com/about/), including this post on [Digital literacy and the impact on user adoption](https://tracyvanderschyff.com/2017/10/05/digital-literacy-and-the-impact-on-user-adoption/). The model Tracey uses in that post looked slightly familiar, and after a bit of digging I think I have managed to place it as emerging from work done in the early part of the 2010's by [JISC](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/), leading a substantial amount of research around the modern digital literacies needed by learners.

Although the original work was around the needs of learners (of all ages) in education, I think it's reasonable to extrapolate to the needs of people working in a wide range of jobs that handle information and knowledge in some form.

Tracey's presentation is written specifically from the perspective of encouraging users to make good use of a set of specific digital tools (in her case the Microsoft Office 365 suite) but I think the model is more general than that. 

Capturing here for future reference,

Looking for definitions, I found and adapted from [Payton and Hague 2010](https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/FUTL06/FUTL06casestudies.pdf), giving us:
