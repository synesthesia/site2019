excerpt: Problems upgrading Twiki

Been having problems with the [Wiki][1]. I&#8217;ve upgraded the [Twiki][2] scripts to the latest (Feb 2003) release and all is not well. Frustratingly it appears to work in some areas but not others. I&#8217;ve been through the upgrade instructions with the proverbial fine-tooth comb so I&#8217;m beginning to conclude it must be something to do with my hosting ISP. Unlike some of the more prolific bloggers out there I find that concentrating on a techie task like that severely reduces my ability and motivation to write&#8230; hence the gap&#8230;

Did line by line check of the twiki.cfg file and now it _seems_ to be working OK. Hmmm don&#8217;t have the satisfying feeling of knowing exactly what made the difference&#8230;.
