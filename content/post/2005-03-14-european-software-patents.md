I believe that innovation is a good thing for any society.

Encouraging innovation requires a balancing act: on the one hand ensuring that individuals are able to benefit from the innovations they produce, and are thus motivated to bring new ideas to fruition; on the other hand protecting society and the effective operation of the market from the stagnation that can arise when a few monopolies are able to control which innovations see the light of day.

> As one of your constituents I write to express my concern about the way the issue of software patents is being handled by the European Commission&#8217;s Directorate for the Internal Market, and to request that, as my representative, you play a full role in ensuring that the Commission&#8217;s attempts to push through a flawed and biased Directive without adequate public discussion are rebuffed by the Parliament.

> The idea of applying patent law to computer code is extremely dangerous and will lead, in time, to a stifling of innovation in Europe and prevent the people of Europe from working together to create great things.

> There is a second issue, a constitutional one, about the way the Commission has apparently ignored a request from the European Parliament to exclude software from the Draft Directive. I respectfully suggest that it is vital that elected Members do not ignore this challenge to the authority of the Parliament.

> The Draft Directive can be rejected by the Parliament, but this will only happen if MEPs attend and vote on the issue. I would appreciate your confirmation that you will be there for the debate.
