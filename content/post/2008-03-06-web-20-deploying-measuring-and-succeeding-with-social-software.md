**Deploying, measuring and succeeding with Social Software**

Ian McNairn, [IBM SWG][2]

What does success mean &#8211; critical mass? application use? customer delight? increased profit? in other words _be clear what you want_.

Know what to measure &#8211; communities and social networks are different things &#8211; determine the business outcome (look for linked indicators) &#8211; get clear about the changes you want to get &#8211; think about cause and effect. Just because it&#8217;s easy to measure, doesn&#8217;t mean it means anything&#8230;

Measure impact and usage &#8211; based on the business outcome. examples, Knowledge Currency, tagging, polls, linking, availability vs. time-to-complain

Pitfalls to avoid &#8211; don&#8217;t decide on metrics without thinking about context, don&#8217;t measure the past, beware &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221;, don&#8217;t try to boil the ocean, don&#8217;t expect all users to have equal understanding.

Deployment tricks to increase success &#8211; pre-populate with content, engage the members in interaction, on-demand in-context help, make enrollment easy, reward contributions by example.
