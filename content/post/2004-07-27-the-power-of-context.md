[Amy Gahran][1] writes about the power of context &#8211; [How Arranging Ideas Spawns New Ideas][2] &#8211; to stimulate new thoughts around a subject:

> No idea exists in a vacuum. It is connected to related ideas, and to the real world, and to other people&#8217;s perspectives. Those connecting threads of context are where the vast creative potential of the human mind lies. cite=&#8221;http://blog.contentious.com/archives/000288.html&#8221;

The idea that the mind works associatively is pretty well established &#8211; amongst many other things it&#8217;s the key behind [mind mapping][3]. Making public some of my own associations I can see a connection between Amy&#8217;s thoughts, Tony Goodson&#8217;s [Butterfly moments and bricolage][4] (worth noting that Tony is a fervent advocate of mind mapping) and the ideas I tried to capture [here][5], in particular: 

> The benefits of any specific piece of knowledge are not always forseeable until the right combination of circumstances and other people arises â€“ in other words unpredictable emergent behaviour; 

Another possible connection is to [The Social Origins of Good Ideas][6]

Where Amy particularly extends our thinking is the way she then derives some very specific ideas for enhancements to knowledge management tools that would take advantage of associative thinking:

* Random elements [&#8230;]
  
* Visual juxtaposition [&#8230;]
  
* Embedded brainstorming tools
  
* Sticky notes (that capture context for the thought) [&#8230;]

There&#8217;s an interesting challenge for developers here but not an insurmountable one I think&#8230; Just needs someone with the skill to hang together a few existing tools perhaps? 

In a sense a blog entry like this is a form of the fourth item (&#8220;Sticky notes&#8221;) because it captures an idea and via a combination of hyperlinks and the use of trackbacks captures a a lot of the context as well &#8211; but it&#8217;s not exactly fast &#8211; how many ideas slip by before you can grab the idea and it&#8217;s context? I think we need a system that treats &#8220;ideas&#8221; as some kind of atom and deals with the messy business of collecting and managing <abbrev title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbrev>s in the background.

For embedded brainstorming tools could someone integrate [Freemind][7] with a [bliki][8]?

Are there any open source developers out there who feel inspired by this?
