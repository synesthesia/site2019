I&#8217;ve just heard that I have passed my PRINCE2 Practitioner qualification, thanks to the excellent help of [Pearce Mayfield][1].

I&#8217;ve been familiar with the [PRINCE2][2] method for a number of years, and have certainly applied the principles to local methods, but have resisted getting into it too formally because of the bureaucratic nightmare I have seen many organisations make from it.

One of the best things I can say about the Pearce Mayfield training is that through it I have seen, by contrast,  how to make PRINCE2 a living and breathing approach to delivering a project.
