Another dive into the archives, [this day in 2004]({{< relref "../../2004/2004-07-27-the-power-of-context.md">}}) I was writing about the power of associative thinking to generate new insights, purely by juxtaposing existing ideas in a new way.

These days it seems we hear of nothing but the power of associative thinking in the context of Zettelkasten or digital gardens, however what many who focus on those current trends ignore (or are perhaps unaware of) is the very long history of tools that support this way of working (e.g. [wiki, 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)), [mind-mapping, 1970](https://www.tonybuzan.edu.sg/about/mind-maps/#:~:text=Originated%20in%201970%20by%20Tony,use%20their%20brains%20more%20effectively.) )
