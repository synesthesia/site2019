Ton expresses his concerns about annotations in any online tool (the example is Hypothes.is) being potentially risky, if nothing else as a consumer of learning time that isn't well integrated with his other notes:

>The type of interaction and annotation I have/do with a source text I normally do locally. Unless it can be a [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) (Post Elsewhere Syndicate to Own Site) flow, exchanging that current value of processing things locally for merely the potential for interaction and conversation is likely a bad trade-off for my learning.

I completely agree, especially when it comes to the decision to start using yet another annotation tool.

Although I do have some page annotations in [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/user/synesthesia), as much as anything that's because the tool is already there, in my browser.

Aside from the risk that your work is sitting in someone else's domain (the _raison d'etre_ of Indieweb!), as I develop my understanding of what I need to do for effective sense-making, the more I have realised that simple annotations sitting isolated from my main notes are almost as useless as bookmarks which are never looked at, and a far worse return on my time. 

Hence the motivation to [build a tool to bring them in to my flow]( {{< relref "/post/2022/2022-05-24-reply-to-ton-zijlstra/index.md" >}} ).
