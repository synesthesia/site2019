It's that time.

I've deleted most of my interaction history using the wonderful [Semiphemeral](https://semiphemeral.com/).

My account is restricted.

After this post I will switch off federation from my blog to Twitter.

Find me on [my blog](https://www.synesthesia.co.uk), or [on Mastodon](https://social.synesthesia.co.uk/@julian)
