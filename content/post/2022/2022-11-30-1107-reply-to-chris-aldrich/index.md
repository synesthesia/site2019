I never really stopped reading stuff in a feed reader (currently for me, [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)).

Probably the biggest (and most useful) change I have made to the habit has been to [rearrange my feeds by social distance]({{< relref  "../../2019/2019-09-25-filtering-information-by-social-distance-2/index.md" >}}) - this immediately means that the people I interact with the most are near the top of my list, so if time is limited their posts are the ones I see first.

However in the interests of widening the pool of ideas, and in the spirit of #FeedReaderFriday I am starting to make a point of randomly sampling sites in the @D500 and @E999 parts of my feeds. At the moment [Chris Aldrich](https://boffosocko.com/blog/) lives in @D500, but the whole point of this organisation is to move feeds up and down the list as the level of interaction changes. I'm finding more and more of interest around knowledge management and indieweb topics in Chris's feed.

You can see the current contents of my reading list as OPML at [this link](/opml/synesthesia.opml). Currently this requires manual updating, it might be worth exploring how to make a call to the Feedly API from within the Hugo build process.
