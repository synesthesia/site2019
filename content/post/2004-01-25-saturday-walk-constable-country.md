Again, a walk taken from the [Time Out Book of Country Walks][1], walk 39, circular based on Manningtree in Essex (TM094322)

Although fairly flat, this area on the border of Essex and Suffolk (The Dedham Vale <acronym title="Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty">AONB</acronym>) has some delightful views. Inevitably, given the geography and the time of year, parts of the walk were very wet, with a couple of detours around flooding needed and a fair amount of mud (on which I blame the rather disproportionate ache in my legs today!)

The area is most famous for the paintings of John Constable, born in East Bergholt. The walk passes the scenes of a number of his paintings, including
  
[The Cornfield][2] (TM069340) and [The Hay Wain][3] (TM077332). 

Although you can see the impact of modern agriculture &#8211; even a couple of field boundaries shown on a 1998 map have disappeared &#8211; you can imagine that much of the area looks unchanged &#8211; in particular the view at Flatford Mill shown in The Hay Wain looks almost identical&#8230;
