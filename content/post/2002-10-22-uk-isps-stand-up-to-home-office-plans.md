The Guardian [reports][1] that the Internet Service Providers Association has written to David Blunkett:

> &#8220;[&#8230;] refusing to sign up to plans to give law enforcement agencies access to the records of British web and email users [&#8230;] the Guardian has learned that internet service providers have told the Home Office that they will not voluntarily stockpile the personal records of their customers for long periods [&#8230;] The apparent collapse of the negotiations may leave Mr Blunkett facing a choice between using his reserved powers under the legislation to force internet providers to comply or dropping the measure in response to political and political opposition [&#8230;]&#8221;
