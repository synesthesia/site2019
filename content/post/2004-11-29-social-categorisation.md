excerpt: "Denham Grey writes about the use of concept extraction to categorise text - I add the nuance of applying this in the reader's context rather than the writer's."

[Denham Grey][1] has been thinking about knowledge management for a long time &#8211; it looks like he has been turning his thoughts to some of the issues I touched on in [Semantic Aggregation and Filtering][2]. He writes in [Social Categorisation][3]:

<blockquote cite="http://denham.typepad.com/km/2004/11/social_categori.html">
  <p>
    The ability to develop and share a common taxonomy / classification / ontology is a very fundamental knowledge practice that leverages knowledge creation, communication, promotes meaning and enables sense-making.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tools to do this are far and few right now but likely to be moving toward center stage in the near future&#8230;
  </p>
</blockquote>

He adds a fourth mechanism for extracting and sharing a taxonomy 

<blockquote cite="http://denham.typepad.com/km/2004/11/social_categori.html">
  <p>
    The starting point for this advance may be tools to <a href="http://www.voght.com/cgi-bin/pywiki?ConceptExtraction">extract key concepts</a> from free form text.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Imagine if you wrote a text, ran a key concept parser, compared the extracted concepts to your groups ontology then selected the best fit meta-tags for later search and browsing &#8211; Now that would really assist content sharing!
  </p>
</blockquote>

to which I would add another nuance &#8211; as well as deploying these tools to categorise your own text how about deploying them inside a feed aggregator with mapping rules based on the reader&#8217;s frame of reference &#8211; this way in addition to using the author&#8217;s taxonomy you could decide how to categorise a piece of content _in the reader&#8217;s context_.
