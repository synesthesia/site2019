Over at [Headshift][1] [Suw Charman][2] has done a [great job][3] of capturing the 11 core themes from the [Blogwalk][4] &#8220;[Window Wiki][5]&#8220;. As people reflect on the event there is discussion about how to best develop the ideas from this session and how to ensure better learning next time. Here&#8217;s my three-ha&#8217;porth, modified slightly from my own [comment][6] to that discussion:

**Reflection and Memory**

Memory-wise I find the &#8220;little black book&#8221; with a few key phrases or bullet points essential to remember the flow of the day.

However I&#8217;m not keen to have a formal plenary &#8220;writing it down&#8221; session; partly so as to make best use of face-to-face time; partly because I find that writing a too-detailed set of notes tends to freeze the thinking at that point rather than allow the ideas to ferment and mature over time. [Ian Glendinning][7] strikes the right chord [here][8] for me.

I do think that a reflection period at the end of each session would be a good way to surface and anchor thoughts without over-formalising.

**Developing the Ideas**

The converse is also true &#8211; to continue the conversations amongst a geographically-dispersed group we are going to need to write it down on blogs, wikis, emails, IM etc. etc. &#8211; perhaps that is where we will begin to express a written emergence of our thinking?

I&#8217;m beginning to think that as well as having the &#8220;seed&#8221; themes (the [11 groupings][9] from the window) to work with it would be very helpful to have some candidate &#8220;research questions&#8221; in each of those areas to focus our output. Each question should combine a focus for the thinking with a &#8220;how could we test this in real life?&#8221;. Food for a later set of posts?

**Technology**

Of course we already have one target output in terms of defining the right toolset (the [bliki]IntraBliki[/bliki]).

The overwhelming majority of issues discussed on the day were around people, interactions, emotions and the psychology of blogging in business &#8211; indeed as [David Wilcox][10] [notes][11] many of these issues are those that relate to any organisational change. However I think it would be dangerous to think that there are no technology challenges left at all. In my experience unless the technology hurdle is very very low then it becomes a great hook for people to hang their &#8220;resistance to change&#8221; issues on. [Anu Gupta][12] has [picked up][13] on this by referring to this Harvard Business School [article][14]

Don&#8217;t forget that we are, by definition, a self-selected group who have been prepared to deal with the technology to get our ideas &#8220;out there&#8221;. The use of social software in the workplace will only succeed (what&#8217;s more _should_ only succeed) if it is successful in letting people do what they need to do more easily &#8211; a means not an end.
