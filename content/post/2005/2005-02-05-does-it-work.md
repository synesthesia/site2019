New on the [blogroll][1] is [The &#8220;Does it Work?&#8221; Diary][2] from my friend Clare Walker.

She&#8217;s taken on the challenge of documenting &#8220;Which personal development techniques actually work&#8221;, and amongst other things is documenting a self-experiment on the positive affect on mood obtained by [abstaining from watching television news][3].

She says:

    I&#8217;m not certain why this may work, but suspect that:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1) The bias of most news is depressing (eg an emphasis on crime, disaster, problems, etc)&#8230;.(And yes, I know that the media can do tremendous good by highlighting poverty, disasters and destruction, but if in the end we&#8217;re all too depressed to respond, that isn&#8217;t, in fact very useful).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2) Most of this is illustrated with pictures (which people&#8217;s unconscious minds just lap up).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3) Watching television is known to induce an alpha-brain-wave, trance-like state
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (the very same state in which it&#8217;s also easiest to create positive emotional change too).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4) I watch most TV news at night&#8230;which is also the time I think of for both myself and my students as being the most powerful for personal development and changework. (Something to do perhaps with tiredness after the day inducing that all-important alpha brain-wave state again.

Try it for yourself!
