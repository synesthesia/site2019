That&#8217;s how long since I posted here.

Some of that has been down to winter solstice ennui.

Some of it down to spending time with loved ones over the Christmas and New Year period.

Some of it because of work stuff (which I don&#8217;t write about here)

Some of it because of some painful transitions in a close relationship, and the transformative change that has followed.

And some of it because I am busy on a new project which you can expect to see mentioned here in the next couple of months.

2005 is going to be an interesting year!
