Part 4 of the pre-work for the [strategy course][1], based on the [tram company][2] fictional case study.

Continuing the [bliki]PARTS analysis[/bliki] started in [part 2][3], I now look at **Rules**, **Tactics** and **Scope**.

**Rules**
  
The overt rules operating on the business appear to be:

  * The restriction to charging a fixed fare, soon to be relaxed to a restriction to charging the same average fare across the season
  * The rules on staffing levels set whilst in public ownership

**Tactics**

**Scope**
