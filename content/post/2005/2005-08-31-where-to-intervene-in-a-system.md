[Developer.*][1] has published [Places To Intervene In a System][2] by the late [Donella Meadows][3], with an afterword by [Don Gray][4] applying the thinking to software devleopment. Thought-provoking stuff &#8211; Meadows herself [cautions][5] that the essay <cite title="https://purpleslurple.net/ps.php?theurl=https://www.developerdotstar.com/printable/mag/articles/places_intervene_system.html#purp62">is not a recipe for finding leverage points. Rather it&#8217;s an invitation to think more broadly about system change</cite>.

In summary (original numbering scheme!), places to think about intervening:

9. Numbers
  
8. Material stocks and flows
  
7. Regulating negative feedback loops
  
6. Driving positive feedback loops
  
5. Information flows
  
4. The rules of the system
  
3. The power of self-organisation
  
2. The goals of the system
  
1. The paradigm or mindset out of which the goals, rules and feedback structure arose.
