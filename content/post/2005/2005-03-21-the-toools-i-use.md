&#8230;browser-based and thick-client.

I&#8217;ve been coming back to the use of a wiki in the work environment, again with project teams, for rapid development of specifications and management of action lists.

Two things that struck me, after spending a large chunk of the working day creating and editing stuff in a group of browser tabs. Firstly, that this is a really good way of developing a set of inter-related ideas; secondly, how it made periodic checking of my [Bloglines][1] feeds list and various email accounts less disruptive: it&#8217;s far easier and faster to `Ctrl-PageDown` to the next [Firefox][2] tab than it is to switch context between browser, email client and word processor. _(And as you will note, implicit in that statement there is also my view that [tabbed browsing][3] is vastly more efficient than the [non-tabbed variety][4].)_

I think there may be a clue here about what needs to be done to increase the use of blogs and wikis in a corporate setting &#8211; if you look at the user patterns within browser-based tools and the more traditional thick-client set of email-wordprocesssor-spreadsheet it is much easier to switch and share within each sub-system than between them.

It&#8217;s an idea I&#8217;ve touched on [before][5]; the question remains will we see an end-to-end solution from Microsoft? Or will the independent tool vendors and the Open Source community be able to come up with something first?
