Renting DVDs by post is all the rage these days. 

I&#8217;ve been enjoying a free trial from Lovefilm.com, but as it draws to a close was debating whether to continue as a paying customer. Via [Going Underground][1] my attention was drawn to the similar service offered by Sainsbury&#8217;s. (Not linking because I don&#8217;t want to give either of them Google-juice.) I got part way through signing up for the free trial but was bounced as an existing member &#8211; you&#8217;ve guessed it, the Sainsbury&#8217;s service is operated for them by Lovefilm.com.

Nothing very exciting there you might think, until you compare the prices for similar services. **Bear in mind these services are being offered by the same company**:

Presumably Sainsbury&#8217;s buying market share by discounting their part of the revenue?
