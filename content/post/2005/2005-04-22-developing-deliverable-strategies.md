I&#8217;ve just received the joining instructions and pre-work for [Developing Deliverable Strategies][1]

There are two pieces of pre-work:

  * [The Right Game: Use Game Theory to Shape Strategy][2] [[notes][3]]
  * Will Biddiford&#8217;s Trams Make a Return? [[notes][4]]

Some interesting stuff to get my teeth into!

As I&#8217;ve noted [here][5] my learning goals are to:

  * Enhance my ability to think strategically
  * Gain further insight into overall business strategy and the ways to support and enhance that with technology.
  * Understand the strategic drivers for organisational success.
  * Acquire a toolkit for strategic thinking.
  * Informal learning through networking with other delegates.
