I&#8217;m an occasional reader of [Whiskey Bar][1] (I don&#8217;t often have the time his posts deserve) but [this][2] seemed especially thought-provoking for the way it captures the feeling that the country in your heart is no longer the one you live in:

  <p>
    [&#8230;]<br /> It&#8217;s a strange place to end up: a man without a country, grudgingly supporting the country he no longer has because the alternatives are so much worse. But that&#8217;s how it goes, I guess, in this world of empires and religious fanatics.<br /> [&#8230;]
