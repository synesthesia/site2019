Here&#8217;s an update on my [experiences][1] with setting up the [Getting Things Done][2] method:

  * Weekly review still takes 2+ hours (that includes doing a few small tasks, and last week a complete clear up of all the paper piles on my desk);
  * Still keeping the email box empty, still feeling the psychological benefits;
  * Increased tendency to write up meeting notes within 24 hours (good for me and for colleagues);
  * General sense of feeling more organised;

Next challenge &#8211; incorporating blogging and other outside-work projects into the plan.
