I&#8217;ve been having a problem with DNS failures on my home setup for the last week or so. So, it would appear, have a [lot][1] of [other][2] [people][3] with similar setups, and it turns out to be the fault of Apple who introduced a version of [Bonjour][4] into iTunes for Windows version 5.

D-Link have published a [workaround][5], but the answer seems to be to [install version 5.0.1 of iTunes][6]&#8230;

<ins datetime="2005-09-24T22:32:49+00:00">Update: It seems that even with 5.01 of iTunes installed you still need to put in the ISP DNS server address in the Windows network config to keep Windows working</ins>
