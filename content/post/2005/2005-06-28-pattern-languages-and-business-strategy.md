I&#8217;ve been working through the [books][1] I added to my collection after the [strategy course][2], especially [Co-opetition][3]
  
and (just started) [Thinking Strategically][4].
  
<span style="float:right; margin:10px; clear:right;"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fivegocrazyinmid%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0393310353%2526location=/o/ASIN/0393310353%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0393310353.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="Thinking Strategically: Competitive Edge in Business, Politics and Everyday Life" /></a></span>
  
When I was on the course, especially as we started to touch on the idea that certain strategies arise inherently from the structure of any situation (especially the [bliki]Value Net[/bliki]) it occurred to me that [design patterns][5] may be the natural way to express the thinking in a condensed form. 

Unfortunately (in one sense) this was also a new idea to the people on the course, and as I didn&#8217;t have time to refresh my rather surface knowledge of [pattern languages][6] whilst I was on the course, I wasn&#8217;t really in a position to develop the thinking.

In the spirit of [release early, release often][7], I&#8217;ve made a small [start][8] with this, indexed at [Strategy Patterns][8], and will continue to build it as I work through the books and a review of my course notes.
