There&#8217;s been an [outpouring][1] of blog [entries][2] about this week&#8217;s [events][3] but strangely I&#8217;ve felt no desire to write myself until now.

I was lucky &#8211; running late for work I was still waiting at my suburban tube station when the network was shut down. That meant I spent the day at home, watching things slowly unfold on the net and the TV. Like many others I know people who were more closely affected, though so far as I know so far all have had lucky escapes.

The desire not to write (until now) has I think been to do with my own preferred way of dealing with new and disturbing events in the world &#8211; in that sense at least I am an introspective person. I&#8217;ve discussed things with people close to me, but not felt that there was something I wanted to write.

I&#8217;ve used the tube since Thursday, and like [others][4] admit to being a little more wary, a little more alert to what was going on around me &#8211; but not really any more so than during [other][5] [times][6] when terrorists were active in this city.

But as the days pass the other emotions come to the surface &#8211; anger that this has happened in the city that has been my adopted home for nearly twenty years, a belief that the most one individual can do is be determined to get on with their life and enjoy [the freedom that London grants][7], and a feeling of utter contempt for the perpetrators who think they can drag us down to their level.

The London News Review says it [bluntly][8], Ken Livingstone has risen to a [surprisingly good level of oratory][7] and unsurprisingly [Tom Coates][9] has said almost exactly what I wanted to say about not writing before I did.

It happened. I feel very sorry for those who have lost loved ones or suffered life-changing injuries, and extend them all the empathy in the world. And now the people who live here are going to just get on with things. 

The end.
