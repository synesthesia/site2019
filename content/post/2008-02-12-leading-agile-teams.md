I’m blogging the conference [Agile Approaches for Delivering Business Value][1]

**Leading Agile Teams**

_[Dot Tudor][2], [TCC][3]_

**Summary**

One school of thought is that good leaders make a big difference to the successful outcome of any initiative. On the other hand, some agilists want to eliminate leaders and go with situational leadership and self-organising teams. There is also a large contingent in the agile community with the view that the right approach is to change the style of leadership, not to eliminate leaders.

This interactive workshop will explore the workings of an agile team and attempt to identify the issues and approaches to leadership styles that support an agile environment. This will be fun, informative &#8211; and there may even be prizes!

**Notes**

Workshop format…

Will have to think about how to transcribe this!
