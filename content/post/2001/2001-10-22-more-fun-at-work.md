In [&#8220;Fourteen Forms of Fun&#8221;][1] [Pierre-Alexandre Garneau][2] lists the broad categories of entertaining activities, in the context of better computer games design. [Co-Working News][3] suggest that these are also fundamental to the design of an effctive co-working experience too. They are:

  * Beauty
  * Immersion
  * Intellectual Problem Solving
  * Competition
  * Social Interaction
  * Comedy
  * Thrill of Danger
  * Physical Activity
  * Love
  * Creation
  * Power
  * Discovery
  * Advancement and Completion
  * Application of an Ability 

Something to think about next time you are trying to fill that job vacancy!
