Tom Cunliffe at [Time for tea][1] pointed me to Annie Mole&#8217;s site called <a href = "https://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/london_underground">London Underground</a>. No, not a trainspotter&#8217;s site, but a complete &#8220;microculture&#8221; &#8211; stuff that those of us who use the Tube every day take completely for granted. Or maybe it&#8217;s irony?
