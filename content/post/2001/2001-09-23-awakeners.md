#### Awakeners

I still don&#8217;t know what to think about current world events.
  
I&#8217;ve been trawling the web searching for contrasting opinions
  
that might help narrow down my thoughts. For example [Dave Winer][1] writes about his own attitudes to the America he lives
  
in and how they are changing, and contrasts this with the pulse
  
of anti-Americanism he feels in Europe. He and others refer to an
  
excellent [Sunday Times article][2] by Brian Appleyard. Appleyard quotes George
  
Orwell from 1941 

> _"In so far as it hampers the British war effort,
      
> British pacifism is on the side of the Nazis and German
      
> pacifism, if it exists, is on the side of Britain and the
      
> USSR. Since pacifists have more freedom of action in
      
> countries where traces of democracy survive, pacifism can act
      
> more effectively against democracy than for it. Objectively
      
> the pacifist is pro-Nazi."_ 

Now this really made me think &#8211; my late father was a
  
conscientious objector during WWII &#8211; and although I never quite
  
understood why, after his death I began to realise how much this
  
was about his very strong sense of _his_ values. However,
  
I began to realise that the key difference between Jack and the
  
"chattering classes" who would knock America now was
  
that he did contribute to the war effort, albeit indirectly. As I
  
wrote in his eulogy 

> _"This isn&#8217;t the time to recap the things he did,
      
> except to note that in his work with the Civil Defence he did
      
> his part to support the community he lived in, regardless of
      
> the prejudice he often faced for his views."_ 

So can our thinking be subtle enough to distinguish between
  
"not bearing arms" and "opposing the war" ?

The essence I think is the difference between on the one hand
  
supporting the society within which you live (even if you set
  
some barriers around what you consider ethical to do in support
  
of that society), or on the other reaping all of the benefits of
  
the society without supporting it. For all that the
  
"fashionable elites" (Islington or otherwise) wish to
  
knock America and the West in general, every aspect of their
  
lives revolves around being part of the Western world, from the
  
economic success of capitalism to the freedom under a democracy
  
to express their opinions.

Yes, undoubtably, there are many millions outside the West who
  
look at our lives (even the poorest of us) with envy, and perhaps
  
millions who look at us with hatred. Many of those who hate
  
exploit those who are envious to gather recruits to their cause.
  
The balancing trick our leaders have to follow is to defend us
  
against those who would destroy our way of life whilst ensuring
  
we do not create more enemies amongst the ones who merely envy.

A [news article][3] today about the background of the terrorists suggests
  
that they were far from being the dispossessed &#8211; so can there
  
really be any weight to the argument that says the West "had
  
this coming"?

Finally for this entry, I&#8217;d like to link to an article by
  
Robert Dilts, written the day after the WTC attack and simply
  
entitled [Reflections
  
on September 11][4].
  
Robert is one of the world leaders in NLP,
  
and a very gentle, thoughtful and spiritual man. In his article
  
he calls on us all to be awakeners, and says: 

> _"The job of the awakener is to shine light into
      
> situations which are dim, not cast his or her own shadow into
      
> the darkness that is already there. Awakeners have no
      
> illusions about human nature so they do not have negative
      
> surprises. But they have a strong belief about what is
      
> possible."_ 

So I wonder what we believe is possible?
