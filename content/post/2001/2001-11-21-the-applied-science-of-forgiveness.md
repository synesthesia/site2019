[Choosing Forgiveness][1] descibes itself as &#8220;dedicated to the challenge of witnessing to forgiveness in a non-forgiving world&#8221;.

The friend who sent me this link quotes one of the documents on the site thus:

> _&#8220;All forgiveness is self-forgiveness. Your experience of the world is the result of your combined state of thought and feeling &#8211; your arena of consciousness. If your experience of the world is a result of your state of consciousness, then if you hate anyone, you are disliking a part of yourself.&#8221;_

Although the original document for the quote is explicitly Christian (the
  
web site is not overtly Christian by the way) I think these words are
  
sufficiently human-centred to hold a truth whatever particular brand of
  
spirit you choose to believe in.
