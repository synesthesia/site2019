In his longer article [You Are Brighter Than You Think][1] he notes the &#8220;first law of psychology&#8221;

> _Each time you notice something which others likely have not, even if seemingly trivial, like the play of shadows on the wall or the way So-and-So came into the room&#8211;and you don&#8217;t express or record that bit of observation, you are reinforcing the behavior of being unobservant. Each time you do express or record such an observation, you are not only reinforcing that perception a la the Principle of Description, but you are reinforcing the behavior of being perceptive and observant._

This is the principle behind his well-known [Image Streaming][2] technique for creative problem solving. 

I was struck by the parallel with something [Rebecca Blood][3] wrote in [weblogs: a history and perspective][4]:

> _Shortly after I began producing Rebecca&#8217;s Pocket I noticed two side effects I had not expected. First, I discovered my own interests. I thought I knew what I was interested in, but after linking stories for a few months I could see that I was much more interested in science, archaeology, and issues of injustice than I had realized. More importantly, I began to value more highly my own point of view. In composing my link text every day I carefully considered my own opinions and ideas, and I began to feel that my perspective was unique and important._
