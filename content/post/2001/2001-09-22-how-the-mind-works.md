Just reading <amazonlink asin="0140244913">How The Mind Works</amazonlink> by [Steven Pinker][1]. After the intro he dives into explaining the computational theory of mind, and now (in the chapter I am currently reading) revisits the theory of evolution and explains how this impinges on the growth of the human mind.

It sometimes takes me a few weeks to read a dense book like this, usually in 20 minute snatches on the tube, so watch this space, there will be more updates to come!
