In [Programme Procurement Strategy &#8211; 1][1] I briefly reviewed the approach from the [OGC Risk Allocation Model for Project Strategy and Procurement][2].

Thinking about how to apply that approach to my own programme, I quickly realised that the range of changes we are seeking to deliver (across technology services, business processes and management capabilities) does not easily sit into a single risk assessment.

So I’m still attracted to the risk-based approach, but it is going to need substantial de-composition of the programme to apply it meaningfully.

I’m going to start with the [Blueprint][3], since that is where our final outcomes are defined. For each area of the Blueprint I will examine each outcome, and analyse against the risk framework from the OGC guide.
