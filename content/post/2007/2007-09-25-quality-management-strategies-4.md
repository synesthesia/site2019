At some point we will have to identify the **who** of Quality Management – who will carry out all of the activities.

Looking at the [last post][1] it occurred to me that a useful simplifying assumption would be to divide the processes into three levels:

<table style="cursor: default; border: 1px dashed #bbbbbb;" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td style="color: #000000; font-size: 11px; cursor: text; margin: 8px; border: 1px dashed #bbbbbb;">
      Meta-Programme Activities
    </td>
    
    <td style="color: #000000; font-size: 11px; cursor: text; margin: 8px; border: 1px dashed #bbbbbb;">
      Quality activities which sit outside the programme
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="color: #000000; font-size: 11px; cursor: text; margin: 8px; border: 1px dashed #bbbbbb;">
      Programme Activities
    </td>
    
    <td style="color: #000000; font-size: 11px; cursor: text; margin: 8px; border: 1px dashed #bbbbbb;">
      Quality activities at the programme level
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="color: #000000; font-size: 11px; cursor: text; margin: 8px; border: 1px dashed #bbbbbb;">
      Project Quality Activities
    </td>
    
    <td style="color: #000000; font-size: 11px; cursor: text; margin: 8px; border: 1px dashed #bbbbbb;">
      Quality activities within individual projects
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<ins style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: green; text-decoration: none; color: green;" datetime="2007-09-26T07:51:13+00:00"></ins>

The activities in the first section are the responsibility of the SRO / Programme Director, often with external help such as audit.

The activities in the second section are the responsibility of the Programme Manager, assisted by the Programme Office

The activities in the third second section are likely to be the responsibility of the individual Project Managers, often assisted by the Programme Office
