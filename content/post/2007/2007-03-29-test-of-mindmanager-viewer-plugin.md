Testing the ActiveX plugin for [viewing Mindjet Mindmanager files in browser][1]. This won&#8217;t work in Firefox unless the [IE Tab][2] add-in is loaded.

If you are using IE and have the [viewer][1] installed you should see a map here:

<!-- Mindjet Map Viewer Control Start -->

<!-- Mindjet Map Viewer Control End -->


  
Although I would love to be able to post interactive maps on my blog, I&#8217;m really turned off by the ActiveX, IE-only nature of this approach. Yes, there is a [workaround][2] available for Firefox, but as that involves embedding an instance of IE in a Firefox tab, it&#8217;s no good for people who don&#8217;t like to even run IE on their machines. (or who don&#8217;t run on Windows)

Perhaps Mindjet should take a hint from the [bubbl.us][3] team (see [previous post][4]) and use a combination of Ajax and Flash for their viewer?

Thanks to [ActivityOwner][5] for [pointing out][6] how to use [IE Tab][2] with this plugin.
