Further reference to the [[MSP]] manual (p77, 2003 version) identifies three areas of programme activities where quality management is involved:

  1. Quality management of the governance arrangements – this corresponds to the top level “Governance Reviews” in [post 3 of this series][1].
  2. Quality assurance and review of project outputs – this corresponds to the lower three levels in [post 3 of this series][1].
  3. Configuration Management of key programme documentation.

Drawing on this we need to add an area to our Quality Management Strategy (item 3 above).

I’m puzzled that the section on Quality Management makes no reference to Benefits Reviews (they appear in the chapter on Benefits Management), but as I’ve [noted][2], they are critical to ensuring the delivery of Value, so in my opinion they should be integrated into this strategy.
