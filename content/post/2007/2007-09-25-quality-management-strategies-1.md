I’ve been thinking about how to put together a [Quality Management Strategy][1] for the programme I am shaping. Question is, where to start…

The MSP Manual says:

> […] used to define and establish the activities for managing quality across the programme

<p dir="ltr">
  which sounds tautologous to me.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  In Chapter 9 on Quality Management, a bit more detail appears:
</p>

> <p dir="ltr">
>   The Quality Management Strategy defines <strong>what</strong> criteria will be used to assess quality, <strong>what</strong> quality activities will be incorporated into the management and delivery of the programme, <strong>who</strong> will be responsible for carrying out these activities, and <strong>how</strong> the programme will meet required audit and organisational standards for quality assurance and quality control.

  In Appendix B there is more specific guidance on the contents:

> <p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
>   Description of the quality assurance, review and control processes for the programme, covering:

>   <li>
>     <div style="margin-right: 0px;">
>       Resource requirements for quality management
>     </div>
>   </li>
> </ul>

<p style="margin-right: 0px;">
  All of which will be very useful to describe the headings, but which doesn’t ask the fundamental question – why are we doing this? A later post…
