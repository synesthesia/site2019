In the last two posts of this series I have started down the line of understanding the value chain of a programme, and therefore **what** it is we need to quality assure.

This post steps back for a moment to think about the sort of process we need to design in our [Quality Management Strategy][1] – the **how** of quality assurance.

One of the major differences between a programme and a project is the very much higher likelihood of change in a programme than in a project:

  * Firstly, the programme itself may change direction over its lifetime, reflecting changes in the surrounding environment;
  * Secondly, the precise makeup of the project portfolio may change to deal with new opportunities and threats, or to accommodate changes in programme direction;
  * Thirdly are the inherent changes within each project in the portfolio.

So the process(es) we invent and document in a [Quality Management Strategy][1] must be designed from the start to accommodate change in any of the inputs. That implies ongoing review at a number of nested levels.
