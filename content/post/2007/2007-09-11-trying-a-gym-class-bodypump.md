As [I mentioned on Saturday][1], I’m looking for ways to get more engaged with my fitness activities, and as my new gym offers a range of classes within the monthly membership fee, I thought I’d try out a couple.

First exploration was last night, when I tried a class called [BodyPump™][2]. This is described in the gym brochure as <cite>A non impact resistance class, using barbells and adjustable weights. This class works all major muscles using a variety of exercises including squats, lifts and curls.</cite>, which sounded like the sort of thing I wanted…

It seems that many of the classes offered in gyms are licensed products, so 5 seconds in Google allowed me to find the website of the company who created this class. There’s an extensive [description][3] of what’s involved, and some videos too, so you know what to expect.

The last time I was involved in any king of group fitness activity (about seven years ago) it looked like [this][4] – no air-conditioning, no trademarks on the workouts, as far as I could tell no-one was ever wearing lycra, and the instructors definitely didn’t have fake tans!

I felt a little self-conscious lining up for last night’s event, especially when the instructor and most of the other participants appeared to have fake tan and lycra in sufficient quantities to open a shop… Also notable that even though I’d picked what sounded like one of the more “gender-balanced” classes, there were only two of us males to a dozen females…

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What did we do?</span>

See the [website][3] – says it all.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How it felt</span>

It’s hard work to follow an instructor who is calling above a music track without PA and in accented English!

Some exercises were relatively easy, whereas others did push to localised failure of the relevant muscle groups. Presumably with practice I would learn better what weight to use for each track.

Quite a lot of lactic acid build up.

Certainly got sweaty, but didn’t get out-of-breath at any point, so probably little or no aerobic benefit.

At the time I didn’t think there was much training benefit, but see the notes below.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I liked</span>

It was something different, and exercised muscle groups and movements which I haven’t exercised in other gym contexts.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I didn’t like</span>

I felt that my form in doing the exercises was compromised by trying to follow the instructor, and synchronise moves with the calls and the music track – I’d rather fit the moves to my own rhythm.

After about 30 seconds of track 7 (Lunges) I stopped because I could feel pain from my knees. The instructor’s reaction when she saw me standing out was to encourage me to continue!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Training notes</span>

Next day I can feel some slight post-exercise ache and fatigue in biceps, triceps, quadriceps, abs and back (especially lower), which suggests there has been some training effect to these areas. Given the high reps / low weights nature of the exercise I suspect that the long term effects would be in the areas of tone and muscular endurance.

More worryingly, I have got some knee pain when I walk upstairs, which confirms my decision to temporarily step out during track 7 (Lunges).

Clearly my knees are still an area of vulnerability – I need to target exercises to strengthen the muscles which stabilise the joint, and lay off anything involving high impact or deep knee flexions for the time being.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will I do this class again?</span>

Probably not in the short term – will see how my knees feel after another month of training.
