I’ve used [Mindmanager][1] as my core information-management tool at work for several years. For the last few months I have also been using it as the underlying support for my “GTD-like” personal productivity processes, augmented with the excellent [ResultsManager][2] add-in from [Gyronix][3].

ResultsManager is very powerful, I particularly like the way it allows me to have a mindmap per project, yet pull all of my “Next Actions” into a single Dashboard mind map. However to exploit this power requires the capture of several pieces of information for each action item.

This is where another Gyronix product comes in – [GyroQ][4] – this provides a hot-keyable place to capture odd thoughts without breaking flow, queueing them for later addition to a set of ResultsManager mindmaps.

One of the great things about GyroQ is that the tag-based interface allows end-users (with the approprioate developer licence) to extend the functionality of the tool.

The most active contributor of new tags and macros is the anonymous [ActivityOwner][5], who is both active on the [Gyronix support forums][6] and runs an excellent website packed with hints, tips, and example [GyroQ tags][7], [MindManager macros][8], and [ResultsManager dashboards][9].

Latest offering from ActivityOwner that I’ve grabbed and put into service is a set of tags and macros entitled [MindReader][10]. This extends the functionality of GyroQ to allow you to enter natural-language phrases such as “Email Bob about project X tomorrow” and have these parsed to create ResultsManager activities with key information fields pre-filled – potentially a huge timesaver.

I run a mixed economy of MindManager versions – X5 at work, 6 at home. MindReader is designed to work with version 6, and I discovered one version-dependency in the code. I’ve posted a fix to [make MindReader work with MindManager 5][11] on the [ActivityOwner wiki][12] [here][11].
