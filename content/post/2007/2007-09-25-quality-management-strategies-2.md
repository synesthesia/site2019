Why do we need a [Quality Management Strategy?][1]

In an [earlier post][2] I wrote about my confusion when starting to think about how to create a quality management strategy for my programme.

Let’s go back to basics – why do we need a Quality Management Strategy?

Fundamentally it’s about ensuring (to an acceptable level of certainty) that the Programme will deliver what it sets out to deliver.

And that is about [Value][3].

A Programme delivers Value through achieving [Outcomes][4] which deliver Benefits.

So the starting point for a Quality Management Strategy has to be around the shaping and validation of Outcomes, and the identification of Benefits.

Shaping of Outcomes is essentially a political process – framing the programme so that it meets the perceived needs of the sponsoring group.

Linking of Outcomes to measurable Benefits is a critical part of [defining the Programme][5], and includes the identification of Benefits, devising a Benefits Management Strategy and validating the Benefits Realisation Plan.

**So the first step in our Quality Management Strategy must be the processes around Planning and Realising Benefits.**

That&#8217;s why [Benefit Reviews][6] are important.
