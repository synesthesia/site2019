I’m still going to the gym, although as I [][1][cref 1025 mentioned] I’m giving organised classes a miss for a while.

I’ve been a few times since my last post, and wanted to capture some of the things I’ve (re-)discovered.

<ol class="decimal">
  <li>
    It’s much easier to focus on aerobic training if you use a <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/3028223.htm">Heart Rate Monitor</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    When the gym is busy, it’s surprising how long it takes to move between exercises, especially if you are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weights">free weights</a> and need to set the weight on each exercise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Making a <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/wikka/ExerciseLog">template</a> with the most common exercises in your routine, and using it to record a workout helps focus and motivation.
  </li>
</ol>
