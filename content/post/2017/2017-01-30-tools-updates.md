I realised that I wasn&#8217;t going to have the time to both write my own theme that I liked and update the site content, and the ugliness of the part-built theme was putting me off using the site &#8211; so I&#8217;ve grabbed the new [Twenty Seventeen][1] theme, and will run with that&#8230;

Notwithstanding what I wrote about [Breaking the Ubiquity of Stream Mode][2]  I pretty much gave up on [Smallest Federated Wiki][3]  when I realised that Yahoo! Passport was going away. Now the [software][4] has been [updated to use social logins][5] I have revived it, and my copy is [here][6].

I was hugely pleased when [Mike Caulfield][7] released [his work][8] on the [Wikity theme to github][9], and I&#8217;m running an instance [here][10].

Let&#8217;s see which of the two [personal wiki][11] tools gets most use!

Lastly, although I still have an instance of [Fargo.io][12] that gets  syndicated into the [Work Notes][13] section here, Dave Winer has given [clear notice][14] that it will cease to work in June due to Dropbox API deprecations. He does have a migration path for a self-hosted outliner using a combination of [S3 storage via an API][15] and the [Little Outliner 2][16] tool, so a future project will be to set up a storage backend for that.
