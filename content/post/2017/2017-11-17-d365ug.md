This week I made my first visit as a new member to the <a href="https://www.crmug.com/home" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dynamics 365 User Group</a> UK chapter meeting.

I&#8217;d been invited to speak about our experiences in using Dynamics 365 and Thunderhead ONE together &#8211; my slides embedded below.

Overall I found the day valuable and enjoyable, especially the review of new features in Dynamics Version 9 from <a href="https://crm.fueledbysleep.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Critchley</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/benwalker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ben Walker</a> detailing his experience with setting up a CI/CD environment for Dynamics.

Secondly as someone speaking at a CRMUG event for the first time I found the atmosphere welcoming and the facilities excellent.

Other highlight &#8211; finally meeting <a href="https://www.develop1.net/public/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scott Durow</a>, the man whose blogs have saved us hours of work with the more arcane aspects of Dynamics!
