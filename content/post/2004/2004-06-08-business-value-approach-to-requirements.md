&#8220;Chris Matts&#8221;:https://abc.truemesh.com/ &#8220;points&#8221;:https://abc.truemesh.com/archives/000306.html to a paper he co-authored with &#8220;Andy Pols&#8221;:https://www.pols.co.uk/blog/index.html on &#8220;Business Value-driven Software Development&#8221;:https://www.pols.co.uk/business-coach/BusinessValueDrivenDevelopment.pdf (PDF) Sounds like obvious common sense to me, which presumably means it doesn&#8217;t happen as much as it could in the real world! ðŸ™‚

In &#8220;another post(Documents Create Antagonism)&#8221;:https://abc.truemesh.com/archives/000305.html he also puts his finger on a common problem with &#8220;Big Design Up Front&#8221;:https://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BigDesignUpFront projects &#8211; namely the dysfunctional behaviour driven on both business and development sides of a project by too much early specification that does not consider the value of requested features.
