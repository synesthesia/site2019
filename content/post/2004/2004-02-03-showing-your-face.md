&#8220;Andy Borrows(Older and growing&#8230;)&#8221;:https://olderandgrowing.blogspot.com/ has discovered the soul of a writer inside an engineer. One of his better recent pieces is as a &#8220;guest writer(Heart @ Work)&#8221;:https://www.heartatwork.blogspot.com/2004\_02\_01\_heartatwork\_archive.html#107579760624826228
   
on &#8220;Heart at Work(Heart at Work: Lois Annich&#8217;s weblog)&#8221;:https://www.heartatwork.blogspot.com, in which he ends with a metaphor that works superbly for me too&#8230;

    It struck me that blogging is like walking around showing your face to the world, making eye contact with those you pass on the street, open to your surroundings. There&#8217;s too much isolation in this world. Bloggers are breaking down the walls.
