Another walk from the [Time Out Book of Country Walks][1]. Walk 4 this time &#8211; a circular walk based on Pangbourne in Berkshire (SU633767) via Cray&#8217;s Pond (SU637805).

This time I thought I&#8217;d hook up with a group from the self-organising [Saturday Walking Club][2]. According to the schedule in the book it was the vigorous section &#8220;doing&#8221; the Pangbourne walk this week. As part of the reason for getting back into walking is to get fit I thought this was a suitable challenge &#8211; not least because the ethos of the group is that everyone goes at their own pace &#8211; so if I did fall behind I wouldn&#8217;t be holding up the rest. (And yes, I know this is not how you run a walking group when you are out in more hazardous territory &#8211; there you go at the pace of the slowest to keep the group together and adjust the itinerary to suit)

As it turned out the pace was fine &#8211; albeit quite brisk (8 miles in 2.5 hours split either side of a lunch stop). Slight chagrin at being comprehensively &#8220;dropped&#8221; up one hill by a couple of people who were both older than me but it&#8217;s a useful reminder of the state of your CV system!

The weather was beautiful on Saturday &#8211; crisp, clear and sunny. An early part of the walk (SU622785 to SU615795) was along a wooded cliff above the Thames, and the low January sunlight did a superb job of picking out the landscape. (Mental note to save up for a digital camera!)
