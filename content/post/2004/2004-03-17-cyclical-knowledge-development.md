[Ian Glendenning][1] (Psybertron Knowledge Modelling WebLog) [points][2] to some articles from disparate domains on cyclical approaches to building knowledge:

  * [Knowledge Engineering in a Real World Case-based Reasoning Application][3]
  * [Acquiring Personal Knowledge for Theory and Therapy][4]
  * [Knowledge Management &#8211; Aspects of Knowledge][5]

I&#8217;ve cross-filed these in the [Action Research][6] category because I think they may have relevance to [Reflection 2][7]
