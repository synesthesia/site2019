Interesting synchronicity of posts that have caught my attention in the last 24 hours

Yesterday I [blogged][1] Suw Charman&#8217;s [thoughts][2] about being a generalist / polymath, in particular the tendency for useful real-world knowledge to come out of the unique overlaps between fields created by the particular experiences of one person.

Earlier today I [linked][3] to Tony Goodson on [Butterfly Moments and Bricolage][4] ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20040519140227/https://tonygoodson.typepad.com/tonygoodson/2004/04/butterfly_momen.html)) (inspired in turn by [Johnnie Moore](https://www.johnniemoore.com/butterfly-moments)) &#8211; his experience that general _tinkering about_ across various subjects and ideas often leads to unexpected benefits at later times.

And now I&#8217;ve just read George Por writing on [How local meetings with global experts can boost CI][5] in which he advocates <q cite="https://www.community-intelligence.com/blogs/public/archives/000263.html">cross-fertilization of generative ideas and transformative practices, across organizational cultural and geographic boundaries</q> and goes on to advocate [horizontalization of learning][6] <q>in a given domain between those who have been giving more or less attention to explore and contribute to that domain</q> &#8211; that to me sounds like conversations between _specialists_ and _generalists_ &#8230; 

George ends his post by extolling the virues of asynchronous methods such as blogs to make the best of face-to-face conversations.

So what is the link between these entries?

For me there are several:

  * _Generalist / Polymath_ learning exists, contributes knowledge and helps the horizontal distribution of knowledge;
  * The public, linked, asynchronous nature of blogs and related technologies both exposes conversations to a wider pool of people and helps the ideas start to flow before any face-to-face meeting;
  * The benefits of any specific piece of knowledge are not always forseeable until the right combination of circumstances and other people arises &#8211; in other words unpredictable emergent behaviour;
