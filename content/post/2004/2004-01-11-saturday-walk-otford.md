In the period before Christmas I&#8217;d already decided that the New Year would be a great excuse to dig out my walking boots and start getting some more fresh air &#8211; seeing [these][1] [three][2] [posts][3] from Euan just spurred things on a little&#8230;

Santa was kind enough to bring me the [Time Out Book of Country Walks][4] &#8211; 53 easy to moderate walks all within about 90 minutes train journey of the capital &#8211; so this weekend it was time to try one out.

For a combination of reasons ended up picking walk 43 &#8211; a circular walk based on [Otford][5] in Kent (TQ532594) going via the Fox and Hounds at Romney Street (TQ550614). 

I&#8217;ve not been walking in this area before but the landscape seems very similar to the Chilterns &#8211; mixture of farmland and woods with typical lowland chalk landscape &#8211; i.e. smallish (but steep-sided!) valleys and lots of mud. Perhaps someone should research the clever physics of mud &#8211; how can the same substance be both sticky and slippery, depending on the angle to the vertical?

The walk was hugely enjoyable &#8211; short enough to do during a short winter day with a late-ish start &#8211; but also far enough both to remind me of how sedentary I&#8217;ve been lately (ouch!) and to bring on that simple inner calmness brought about by a combination of exercise, fresh air and being out in the English countryside.
