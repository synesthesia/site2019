Although I first skimmed [this paper][1] [back in May][2] I&#8217;ve finally got around to reading it properly and writing some [summary notes][3].

At an emotional level I feel pleased that a behaviour that I find natural (i.e. to dip into different work groups or areas of study and share ideas between them) and feel to be one of the more useful of my talents is shown to have measurable benefits. If anything it prompts the networker&#8217;s perennial question &#8211; &#8220;which groups _haven&#8217;t_ I tapped into yet?&#8221;
