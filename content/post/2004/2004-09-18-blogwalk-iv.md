Yesterday was [Blogwalk IV][1] &#8211; a very enjoyable and mind-stretching day talking with other bloggers on the theme of &#8220;How will the world of work change as a result of social software use inside the firewall&#8221;.

Thanks to the excellent &#8220;light touch&#8221; facilitation from [Lilia Efimova][2] and [Johnnie Moore][3] we covered a range of topics technical, cultural, managerial, commercial and more&#8230; (there will be more posts over the next few days as I and others get on with our agreed actions!)

Some of the other people there: (apologies if I&#8217;ve left you off)

  * [Ian Glendinning][4]
  * [David Wilcox][5]
  * [Anu Gupta][6]
  * [Riccardo Cambiassi][7]
  * [Suw Charman][8]
  * [Martin Roell][9]
  * [Chris Macrae][10]
  * [Ed Mitchell][11]
  * [Louise Ferguson][12]
  * [Lloyd Davis][13]
  * [Desiree Gosby][14] 
  * [Omar Green][15]
  * [Mark Brady][16]
  * [Paul Goodison][17]

[Lee Bryant][18] dropped in for lunch
   
and [Matt Mower][19] joined for dinner&#8230;

Disappointed that [George Por][20] couldn&#8217;t make it but I&#8217;m sure we will catch up again soon George!
