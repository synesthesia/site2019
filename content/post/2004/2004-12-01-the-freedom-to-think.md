When I wrote [this article][1] I started from a belief that by combining [Denham&#8217;s thoughts][2] with my [earlier post][3] I had seen a new aspect of the possibilities for knowledge aggregation and filtering.

Then I read the background links that led to [this addition][4], added in a spirit of &#8220;Oh, perhaps it wasn&#8217;t that original after all, I&#8217;d better acknowledge this other work&#8221;. In other words some of the glow of achievement I felt about spotting the earlier idea had been tarnished.

Today via [Phil Jones&#8217; wiki][5] I found this David Weinberger [post][6] from a few years ago which has restored some of the good feelings &#8211; others may have had a similar idea before but that doesn&#8217;t reduce the value _to me_ of the new-to-me thought.
