In this post I linked to interesting articles by [Johnnie Moore][1] and [Jack Vinson.][2]

A key part of both posts was a link back to a piece of research mentioned in a book review of &#8220;Friends in Low Places&#8221; posted on author James Willis&#8217; [site][3]. The critical piece was a reference to this part of the review:
