&#8230;is not a phrase you would normally associate with a gathering of bloggers but as anyone who has sampled &#8220;Garlic and Shots&#8221;:https://www.fluidfoundation.com/venueDetails.asp?BarRef=372&#8242; penchant for putting the allium into every item of food and a good sampling of the drinks will know it is not a venue in which the undead would remain comfortable for long.

So, another one of &#8220;those blogger meetup things&#8221; graced by (amongst others) &#8220;Doc&#8221;:https://doc.weblogs.com/, &#8220;Cory&#8221;:https://www.craphound.com/, &#8220;Danah&#8221;:https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/, &#8220;Suw&#8221;:https://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog, &#8220;Matt&#8221;:https://matt.blogs.it/, &#8220;James&#8221;:https://www.imajes.info/, &#8220;Tom&#8221;:https://www.plasticbag.org/, &#8220;Gary&#8221;:https://weblog.garyturner.net/index.html, &#8220;Tom&#8221;:https://www.sparklefluff.com/blatantoptimism/, &#8220;Paul&#8221;:https://www.paranoidfish.org/ and of course &#8220;Euan&#8221;:https://www.theobviousblog.net/blog/

We did the usual untramelled conversation thing, &#8211; isn&#8217;t it amazing how that is now becoming somewhat expected in these meetups rather than the great surprise it was to everyone a while ago!

Gary (of course) was the first to moblog the event , Doc had the best camera, Danah the wildest hat and Suw the best idea (but that&#8217;s for her to tell&#8230;)
