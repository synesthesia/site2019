In the same [post][1] that I just [blogged][2] Johnnie Moore goes on to say:

> Traditional models of group thinking seem based on me trying to cement my well-formed brick of thought to your well-formed brick. Increasingly, I find much more satisfaction in sharing the less-formed ideas and responses I have to conversations. I sense that by doing so, it&#8217;s possible to create some sense of joint intelligence that can get beyond existing mental models.
  
> I suppose that my blogging process tends towards bricks, as I write down ideas and get to tweak and edit them and improve them, to make them more palatable to the outside world. 

For me this is the nub of why I need a blog plus [me-writable][3] and [world-writable][4] wikis. 

Blog posts by their nature are a snapshot at a point in time and therefore imply some form of stasis. Wiki pages however are timeless and hence never finished, always open to flux.

I&#8217;ve found the writing style that has started to evolve since I had this combination of tools is to scatter thoughts around the wiki-spaces until some juxtaposition forms that is sufficiently clear to create a blog-entry. The blog-entry becomes a picture of my thinking at a point in time and therefore essential to mapping out some kind of path. The state of the wiki pages continues to evolve &#8211; by looking where there is activity you can see which parts of my mental associations are currently to the forefront of attention.
