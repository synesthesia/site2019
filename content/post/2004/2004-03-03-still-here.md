excerpt: |
  In between working too hard and squeezing in odd days off to use up holiday I seem to have been spending most of my time doing things which either I can't/won't blog about or which haven't stimulated any blogging-related thought!
  
  The online Action Research 'course':https://www.scu.edu.au/schools/gcm/ar/areol/areolhome.html I mentioned 'earlier':https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/blog/archives/action_research/000289.php has kicked off - there have been two modules published. Traffic on the discussion group seems so far to be about 10 emails per day, mostly still intros of participants. I can however see that I shall have to explicitly schedule time to take this in, work with the materials, contribute to the groups.
