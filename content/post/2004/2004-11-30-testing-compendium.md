At the [suggestion][1] of [Marc Eisenstadt][2] I&#8217;ve been trying [Compendium][3].

The tool itself seems relatively straightforward (I have used both [cognitive mapping][4] and [mind map][5] software before so this may not be a fair assessment of how a beginner would get on) &#8211; the trick I suspect is in learning a methodical approach to applying it to a specific task.

I experimented trying to map out the exchange of views in the recent &#8220;Hierarchy&#8221; exchange ([1][6] [2][7] [3][8] [4][9] [5][10] [6][11] [7][12]) [_order may not be quite right_] between [Dave Rogers][13] , [Jon Husband][14] and [Euan Semple][15] but ran out of steam partway through analysing the second post. I don&#8217;t think that is a comment about [Compendium][3], more a facet of the difficulty of mapping this sort of writing especially when you are very rusty at that sort of thing.

This will be the problem with creating the [semantic web][16], it&#8217;s completely conceivable to have nice well-formed [RDF][17] triples as a way of navigating information that is already structured but the vast majority of human knowledge is tied up in messy human-written text. 

My gut feeling is that most of us, most of the time, don&#8217;t analyse information to the depth that is needed to make good use of a tool such as Compendium. Certainly my tendency is for a strong degree of pragmatism in my learning &#8211; I&#8217;d suggest that generally knowledge-workers dig just enough to get a sufficient gist of things for the immediate purpose &#8211; as long as I have _good enough_ knowledge for the task in hand then why seek more precision? 

The willingness to stop digging could be increased by the [illusion of explanatory depth][18]. This tendency for people to over-estimate their knowledge of a subject where there are attractive intuitive explanations was identified in 2002 by [Frank Keil][19] and [Leonid Rozenblit][20]. _I&#8217;m probably doing it now of course!_

The next area to try Compendium will be working the other way &#8211; assembling a set of facts or assumptions about the world and seeing if it helps extrapolate meaningful abstractions. The obvious application of this will be in strategy development.
