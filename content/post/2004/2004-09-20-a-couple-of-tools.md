&#8220;Wikidpad&#8221;:https://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/ is a personal wiki-like notepad for Windows. I use the registered version of this every day as my main personal note-taking tool at work.

&#8220;Qumana&#8221;:https://qumana.com/ is currently in beta &#8211; a microcontent editing / publishing tool that is designed to make it easy to pull together links and text then post to various destinations.
