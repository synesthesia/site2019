  IE6 doesn't seem to recognise     the<code> max-width</code> tag, so I've added an <code>overflow:hidden</code> to the right-hand menu bar that stops it pplurging all over the page in IE6 if one of the text items is too long.

IE6 doesn&#8217;t seem to recognise the  `max-width` tag, so I&#8217;ve added an `overflow:hidden` to the right-hand menu bar that stops it splurging all over the page in IE6 if one of the text items is too long.
