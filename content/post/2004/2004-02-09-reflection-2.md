I [mentioned][1] earlier that I was looking at [this free course][2] on Action Research.

In one of the [background documents][3] Bob Dick describes a number of typical questions that one might ask during an Action Research intervention. Working through these (see <wiki>QuestionsToGuideReflection</wiki>) it seems to me that what he is describing is a form of double reflection around action&#8230;

**Reflection 1** occurs as part of the planning process, and serves to make explicit the mental models being used in the planning process.
  
**Reflection 2** is (perhaps) the more familiar one from the <wiki>KolbLearningCycle</wiki> that serves to update mental models as a result of learning from action&#8230;

As someone from a pragmatic background rather than an academic training, the attraction I can see in learning Action Research is the greater skill it will give me at reflecting on practice. The nuance of Reflection 1 & 2, I suspect, will take that even further&#8230;
