Walking around [Samuel Palmer][1]&#8216;s &#8220;Valley of Vision&#8221;, between Otford (TQ532594) and Eynsford (TQ535649) in Kent. Again, inspired by [Time Out Book of Country Walks][2], this time a modified version of Walk 23 (left out the dip down into Shoreham for lunch)&#8230; I think I&#8217;m starting to notice the positive effect of these walks &#8211; certainly felt much stronger towards the end of this walk than in earlier weeks &#8211; and was rewarded with a fabulous sunset&#8230;
