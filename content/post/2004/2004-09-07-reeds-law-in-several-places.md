It is the nature of mind to filter experience through the most recent or most strongly held concepts. 

No wonder then that after (finally) coming across &#8220;Reed&#8217;s Law&#8221;:https://www.reed.com/Papers/GFN/reedslaw.html thanks to &#8220;this&#8221;:https://smartpei.typepad.com/robert\_patersons\_weblog/2004/08/reeds\_law\_and_t.html thought-provoking article by &#8220;Robert Paterson&#8221;:https://smartpei.typepad.com/ I shortly noticed these two:

* Adina Levin in &#8220;describing&#8221;:https://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001477.html the recent &#8220;experiments&#8221;:https://alex.halavais.net/news/index.php?p=794 to test Wikipedia&#8217;s resilience spots that the real power of Wikipedia&#8217;s &#8220;defensive techniques&#8221;:https://frassle.rura.org/wikipediaShowsIts lies in the effect they have of turning the site <q cite="https://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001477.html">into a warren of virtual neighborhoods</q>
  
* In [bliki]Building Public Value[/bliki] the &#8220;BBC&#8221;:https://www.bbc.co.uk/ is seeking to link its strategy with the greater public good in support of the argument for Charter Renewal. A lot of the BBC document talks about the power of that unique organisation to build a sense of community amongst various parts of the British population (an example of an activity that specifically stimulates group-forming would be &#8220;iCan&#8221;:https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ican/). Could this strategic direction be the best example yet of a broadcast-based organisation learning to tap the power of &#8220;Reed&#8217;s Law&#8221;:https://www.reed.com/Papers/GFN/reedslaw.html ??
