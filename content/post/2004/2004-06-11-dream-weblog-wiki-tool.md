&#8220;Lilia Efimova&#8221;:https://blog.mathemagenic.com/ is writing about her &#8220;dream weblog / wiki tool&#8221;:https://blog.mathemagenic.com/2004/06/08.html#a1233. Some really interesting ideas about how to combine the tools to support her &#8220;favoured approach&#8221;:https://blog.mathemagenic.com/2004/04/08.html#a1160 of blog to capture inital thoughts and wiki to refactor into output documents.
