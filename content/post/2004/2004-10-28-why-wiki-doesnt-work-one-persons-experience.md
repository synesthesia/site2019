I&#8217;ve been introducing wikis into my workplace, especially for project teams &#8211; not in any forced way but more by making the technology available and starting to use it. Understandably the takeup is mixed but I was most surprised by the very strong aversion expressed by another senior technology manager with whom I have to produce complex joint strategy documents. Last week the opportunity came up to ask &#8220;why doesn&#8217;t wiki work for you?&#8221;; I was expecting answers that were about the difference between a web interface and a wordprocessor, or perhaps issues about the markup but what he told me had nothing to do with the technology and everything to do with mental models.

I&#8217;ve written before about [how blog and wiki fit together for me][1] and my mental model of document outlines and mindmaps as two dimensional [projections of knowledge][2]. In short I&#8217;ve found that for capturing and structuring &#8220;flow of thought&#8221; ideas in a way that can later be linked together the easy hypertext writing style of wikis works very well &#8211; I find myself thinking in terms of hyperlinks as I write.

By contrast my colleague finds the typical collection of wiki pages with dense hyperlinks very difficult to map into a mental structure of information. Under some gentle questioning he explained that for him information is always hierarchical &#8211; the technique he has found that works for him when organising knowledge is to think in &#8220;high level&#8221; concepts and then expand these down into details &#8211; the sort of model that fits very well with traditional outlining or a mindmap where you are not allowed to cross-link between branches. 

What for some people is a strength of wiki &#8211; that any given page can appear in many different contexts depending on the relationship of hyperlinks &#8211; is for him a disadvantage of almost show-stopping proportions (certainly enough to make it too much effort to switch to the tool) because it is impossible to see a single clear hierarchy of information.

The obvious workaround that we will try for areas where we have to work jointly is for him to write &#8220;his stuff&#8221; in outline form and for me to construct index pages that present a view into &#8220;my stuff&#8221;; as we work on joint editing we can then pull together further pages that present different hierarchies.

I can sense a few vague ideas starting to bubble about how the tool itself could be changed but they aren&#8217;t making themselves articulable yet.
