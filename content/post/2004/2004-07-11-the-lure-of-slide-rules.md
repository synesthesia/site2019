Over at &#8220;Davos Newbies&#8221;:https://www.davosnewbies.com/ Lance Knobel is writing about &#8220;the lure of the slide rule&#8221;:https://www.davosnewbies.com/2004/07/08#theLureOfTheSlideRule:

bq. &#8220;Those of us who love slide rules are by definition not Luddites. It&#8217;s the tactile nature of the technology that excites, rather than a revulsion against the technologies that replaced it. There were gains provided by electronic calculators. Our work, lives and society are being dramatically transformed &#8211; and I believe generally improved &#8211; through near-ubiquitous computing. But there are losses from the slide rule age that are more than nostalgia. It&#8217;s better to be a tool user than a tool manager.&#8221;

I too was one of the last generation at school not only to learn about this device but to use it on a daily basis. Lance touches (!) on the tactile nature of the tool yet this goes beyond pure pleasure &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it is too far-fetched to say that using a slide rule gives you a real \_feel\_ for numbers&#8230; After all how else can you easily demonstrate that to multiply two numbers you can add the logarithms? (yes, we used log tables too!).
