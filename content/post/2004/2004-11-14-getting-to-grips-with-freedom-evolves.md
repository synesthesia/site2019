I&#8217;ve started reading [bliki]Freedom Evolves[/bliki] again &#8211; I&#8217;ve had the book on my shelf for a few months but had found it difficult to stick with before. I&#8217;ve noticed that one of the ways that I stop myself from finishing &#8220;stretching&#8221; books (even though I want to learn the contents) is by failing to take notes &#8211; I&#8217;m going to try to address that by using the [Oddments][1] space.
