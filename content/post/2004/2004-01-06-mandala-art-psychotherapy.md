excerpt: 'Mandalas are circular designs that can be used in meditation or used as a way for personal growth and spiritual enrichment.  The language of mandala is symbolic.  The colors and the images in your mandala will reflect your inner self. There is no rule that you have to use certain kinds of color or certain types of material to create your mandala.'
