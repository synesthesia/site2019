The theme of [Blogwalk IV][1] was the use of social software inside the firewall. 

We noted that there were certain technological barriers to be overcome before the tools were sufficiently invisible to support a wide acceptance of corporate blogging / wiki etc. 

I agreed to start some work to define the requirements of the ideal internal corporate blog / wiki tool so I&#8217;ve started writing some initial user requirements in the wiki. The root of the notes is at [wiki]IntraBliki[/wiki], please join in if you are interested.
