excerpt: |
  The theme of <a href="https://blogwalk.mediapedagogy.com/">Blogwalk IV</a>  was the use of social software inside the firewall. 
  
  We noted that there were certain technological barriers to be overcome before the tools were sufficiently invisible to support a wide acceptance of corporate blogging / wiki etc. 
  
  I agreed to start some work to define the requirements of the ideal internal corporate blog / wiki tool so I've started writing some initial user requirements in the wiki. The root of the notes is at <a href="https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/wiki/IntraBliki">IntraBliki</a>,  please join in if you are interested.
