Noting down a few interesting uses/modes of blogging that have caught my eye this week

For [Dave Winer](http://davewiner.com) pretty much every form of writing text is an outline - as a result he has created some interesting tools, the ubiquitous glue of [RSS](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html), and a distinctive [blogging style](http://scripting.com).

By contrast [Michelle Ockers](https://michelleockers.com/blog/) mixes a blog with "Daily Dispatches" (a similar show-your-work concept to the Work Notes here, but really stands out for her use of cideo, including on her [introduction](https://michelleockers.com)

Then there's the whole [weeknotes](https://weeknot.es/publishing-your-weeknotes-to-weeknot-es-289ab12076ac) thing - like a slightly longer show-your-work post (although that site loses IMHO by being Medium-only)
