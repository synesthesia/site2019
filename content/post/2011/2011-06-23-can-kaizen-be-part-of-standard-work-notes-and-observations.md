<a title="JOe Dager's website" href="https://business901.com/" target="_blank">Joe Dager</a> (<a title="Joe Dager's Twitter profile" href="https://twitter.com/#!/business901" target="_blank">@business901</a>) has posted a video interview with [Dr. Michael Balle, the Gemba Coach at the Lean Enterprise Institute][1] about [Kaizen Teams without Kaizen Events][2], or [Can Kaizen be part of Standard Work][2]?

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary</strong></span>

Balle makes some key points:

Standard work is about routine v non-routine, prescribed v non-prescribed

Standards are not the same as saying everything the same for everyone everywhere

Standards = a scientific process

  * the few things we know &#8220;mountains of certainty&#8221; &#8211; standards are very useful here
  * &#8220;the islands of we believe so&#8221; &#8211; standards are looser and we need to understand if the standard applies &#8211; need to do kaizen to understand why situation is different
  * &#8220;the oceans&#8221; of &#8220;we just don&#8217;t know&#8221; &#8211; need to do kaizen to see if we can find a starting standard

Dager makes the point &#8211; how do we make this real for the busy middle-manager?

Balle&#8217;s view is that it is about a change of mindset, from &#8220;too many fires for Kaizen&#8221; to &#8220;the fires are in a state where I can live with them, I have to do the Kaizen first to reduce the number of fires&#8221;.

What is the first step of the 100 steps? What can you do in 1 minute every day?

Aligning the steps with the strategy, but break it down into small steps.

Typically takes five or ten  Kaizen to understand a topic.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thoughts</span>**

For me this was a very timely post &#8211; in my last post on making a [Kanban Review and Retrospective][3] part of  Standard Work with the team I am coaching I describe our first steps to standardise the process of reflection &#8211; which should enable a bootstrapping to a more effective process.

It always helps to have a conceptual framework for what you do, and I sense  the differentiation between &#8220;mountains of certainty&#8221;, &#8220;islands of  we believe so&#8221; and &#8220;oceans of we just don&#8217;t know&#8221; will be most useful.
