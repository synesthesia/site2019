This blog turned ten years old a couple of weeks ago.

Looking back at how I used to blog [back then][1] I see that it was mostly comment on current events.

My first post was about a book &#8211; [How the Mind Works][2] <img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=fivegocrazyinmid&#038;l=as2&#038;o=2&#038;a=0140244913" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />by [Steven Pinker][3]. I think I still have that book somewhere, although it may have been one of the many that I parted company with during the course of four house moves since that time. Of course, if I really wanted, I could buy it again, and start reading it within minutes thanks to the wonders of pervasive internet retailing and e-books.

In the intervening years there have been several lean periods, where the only posts have been automated linklogs from delicious &#8211; as far as I can see I [started doing that in January 2004][4], so the basics of [lifestreaming][5] are pretty old now!

I started on Moveable Type, but [migrated to WordPress in May 2004][6]

These days most content here is aggregated from other sources: links I have captured, comments on other blogs, tweets I have made; but I still think there is a place for the personal site, often with blog-like features. The role of a site like this is still, I think, to be a personal hub, reflecting the flow of online engagement, learning and co-creation.

Here&#8217;s to the next 10 years!
