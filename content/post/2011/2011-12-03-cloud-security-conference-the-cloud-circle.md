I spent a mind-stretching few hours yesterday at the <a href="https://www.thecloudcircle.com/event/2nd-cloud-circle-security-conference" target="_blank">Cloud Security Conference</a> organised by <a href="https://www.thecloudcircle.com/" target="_blank">The Cloud Circle</a>.

Summing up the whole day into a few points is hard, but these were the key things I took away:

  * Security for the Cloud is mostly “just” security, with a few new architectures and contract models
  * Know what data you collect and use, and the associated risks
  * Know where your data goes, how it gets there and how it might be exposed
  * Cloud delivery usually gives you less control
  * But sometimes less control is also less risk
  * Different landscapes give you different control & risk profiles (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS)
  * The importance of knowing about data location and what jurisdictions apply – remember services are often composites from many sub-providers
  * if it’s important to you, talk about it with the vendor and get it in the contract – and involve the legal advisors early
  * But don’t expect a custom contract for 5p/hr computing bought on a credit card!
  * The importance of standards (but this is still an immature market, so not everything has a standard)
  * Plan for something to fail, because it will

I can say with absolute certainty that I am not doing full service to the depth of presentations – I recommend looking for the slides on The Cloud Circle’s website.

**The Cloud Circle**

I’ve been to a few events organised by The Cloud Circle, and I whole-heartedly recommend them. The events are sponsored, and free for delegates. The organisers are pretty good at keeping speakers relatively agnostic and avoiding overt sales pitches, regardless there are always a good mix of vendors, so with care you can pick out the common threads.

The delegates are a good mix, and I always learn something from the questions from the floor.
