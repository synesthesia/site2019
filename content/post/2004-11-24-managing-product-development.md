[Johanna Rothman][1]&#8216;s [Observations from a Writing Workshop][2] &#8220;If you&#8217;d like to write &#8212; or write better, start. You can start short, with 5 or 10 minute timed writing. (Write for 5 or 10 minutes. Do not stop. Keep writing. If you get stuck, write blah, blah, blah, but keep writing.)&#8221; [via [Clarke Ching][3]]
