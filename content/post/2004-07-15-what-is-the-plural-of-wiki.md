I&#8217;ve added a &#8220;second wiki&#8221;:https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/blog/wiki/ for no particularly good reason other than I saw how the anonymous author of Weblog Tools Collection had &#8220;integrated&#8221;:http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2004/07/05/wordpress-12-wiki-integration/ [bliki]ErfurtWiki[/bliki] into WordPress and decided I wanted one too! This one is just for me &#8211; a different sort of publishing space without the time-bound nature of the blog but closely integrated into it. 

I shall still keep the original, more fully-featured &#8220;Tiki-based&#8221;:http://tikiwiki.org/ &#8220;wiki&#8221;:https://www.synesthesia.co.uk/tiki/ for more collaborative or &#8220;major&#8221; bits of writing &#8211; not quite sure what the difference between the two areas is but they feel as if they both have a place&#8230;
