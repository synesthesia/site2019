	"description": "On the topic of blogging and personal publishing, I found so many interesting articles and nuggets of wisdom the last couple of months through RSS feeds, Mastodon and micro.blog. I collected most of it in a Drafts file with the intention to write a blogpost that connects it all with some thoughts from myself. But, as it goes, life just happens and nothing comes of it. So why not just share it and make sure others can enjoy it too.",
