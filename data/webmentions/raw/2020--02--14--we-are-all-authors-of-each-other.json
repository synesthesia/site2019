It is no less exhaustible than presence itself. By nature and design, it can’t be tragic, any more than the Universe can be tragic.</p>\n<p>He then lists 9 enclosures of that commons currently visible, because enclosure is one of the affordances the internet provides.</p>\n<p><em>See, the Internet is designed to support every possible use, every possible institution, and—alas—every possible restriction, which is why enclosure is possible. People, institutions and possibilities of all kinds can be trapped inside enclosures on the Internet.</em></p>\n<ol><li>\n<em>service provisioning, for example with asymmetric connection speeds.</em> Asymmetry favours consumption over production. Searls singles out cable companies specifically for wanting this imbalance. I’ve been lucky from early on. Yes until fiber to the home, we had asymmetrical speeds, but I had a fixed IP address from the start and ran a web server under my desk from the mid ’90s until 2007 when I started using a hoster for this blog. I still run little experiments from my own server(s) at home. The web was <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/02/the-web-through-a-30-year-old-lens/\">intentioned to be both read and write</a> even at the level of a page you visited (in short the web as online collaboration tool, in a way like Google documents). For most people the general web is preceived as read-only I assume, even if they participate in silos where they do post stuff themselves.</li>\n<li>\n<em>5G wireless service</em>, as a way for telco’s to do the same as cable companies did before, in the form of content-defined packages. I am not sure if this could play out this way in the Netherlands or the EU, where net neutrality is better rooted in law, and where, especially after the end of roaming charges in the EU, metered data plans either have become meaningless as unmetered plans are cheap enough, or at least the metered plans themselves are large enough to make e.g. zero-rating a meaningless concept. 5G could however mean households might choose to no longer use a fixed internet subscription for at home, and do away with their own wifi networks, I suspect, and introducing a new dependency where your mobile and at home access are all the same thing and a singular choke point.</li>\n<li>\n<em>government censorship</em>, with China being the most visible one in this space, but many countries do aim to block specific services at least temporarily, and many countries and collections of countries are on the path to realising their own ‘data spaces’. While understandable, as data and networks are strategic resources now, it also carries the risk of fragmentation of the internet (Russia e.g.), motivated ostensibly by safety concerns but with a big dollop of wanting control over citizens.</li>\n<li>\n<em>the advertising-supported commercial Internet</em>. This is the one most felt currently. Adtech that tracks you across your websurfing habits, and not just in the silos you inhabit</li>\n<li>\n<em>protectionism</em>, which Searls ties to EU privacy laws, which I find a very odd remark. While GDPR could be better, it is a <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2018/05/gdpr-as-qa/\">quality instrument with a rising floor</a>, that is not designed to protect the EU market, but to encourage global compliance to its standards. A way of shaping instruments the EU uses more often, and has proven to be a succesfull export product. The cookie notices he mentions are a nuisance, but not the result of the GDPR, and in my mind more caused by interpreting the (currently under revision) cookie law in a deliberate cumbersome way.

This is the efforts by silos like FB to bring the ‘next billion’ online in a fully walled garden that is free of charge and presented as being the web, or worse the internet itself.

For instance it is quite feasible to have my own search engine that only searches all the blogs I subscribe and have subscribed to (I actually should build that). At the same time, there is a slow steady and increasing effort of bringing more of the old, just not the old web, online by the ongoing digitisation of physical archives and collections of artefacts.
